Pakistan players were plotting to sabotage Shahid Afridi's captaincy of their Twenty20 team at the time of alleged spot-fixing during the fourth Test against England at Lord's last year, a court heard on Tuesday.Mazhar Majeed, a cricket agent, made the claims in a taped conversation with Mazher Mahmood, an undercover journalist for the News of the World.The conversations form the basis of the prosecution case against Salman Butt, the then Pakistan Test captain, and Mohammad Asif, the world No 2-ranked bowler at the time.The pair are charged with cheating at gambling and accepting corrupt payments in return for fixing events at Lord's, which they deny."A lot of the boys, they want to fuck up Afridi because he's trying to fuck up things for them, and he's the captain of the Twenty20 and one-day," the agent said on the tape played in court."The Twenty20s are about to start, we're gonna be making a hell of a lot of money," Majeed added."I will tell the bowler, how many minimum runs they are going to concede, which is more, much more, than usual."They are going to concede these runs. With the batsmen I'm gonna tell you how many, for example the two opening batsmen Salman [Butt] and Kamran [Akmal], for example … you've only got 20 overs, they are going to waste two overs, three overs."The allegations were made during conversations between Majeed and Mahmood, who was posing as an Indian businessman with an interest in manipulating events at cricket matches. It was not his only claim, as Butt's lawyer, Ali Bajwa, highlighted.Bajwa painted Majeed as someone who "engaged in a fantastic amount of name-dropping" and who made "derogatory comments" about a number of high-profile figures, including the former England captain David Gower and Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari.The court heard that Majeed is alleged to have said: "Zardari, the president of Pakistan, everyone knows he killed his wife."Bajwa detailed how Majeed talked about "how he came to know Liam Brady", the director of the football academy at Arsenal, and about how a film to which he had contributed had won a Golden Globe award.The court heard there were also claims that Majeed had been involved in a £12m book deal for the England footballer Rio Ferdinand's autobiography and in another, for $6m (£3.85m), for the recently retired Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Akhtar."Another name, another claim," said Bajwa. All of this, Bajwa said, would give the jury "a measure of the character of Majeed".One Majeed claim previously heard in court, that an unspecified number of Australians had been involved in spot-fixing events at international cricket matches, was contested by one of the prosecution's expert witnesses.Alan Peacock, a senior investigator at the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption and security unit, told the court there was "no evidence" that Australian players had been involved in any such activity in 2010.Peacock did say that there had been "a trend over the years for spot-fixing or fancy fixing".During the morning session the court was told that Mahmood came under pressure from Majeed to pay up a £150,000 deposit after his players became suspicious of his conduct."They're saying if they're worried about £150,000 then what will happen when it comes to the big money," the court heard Majeed saying."They said to me why's he not delivering because he wants to see one no-ball. What else does he want?"What they're saying is that this never happens in this game where we give you something and then you give me something because you want something from my boys."They're saying: 'Why's he not parting with £150,000 up front?' They're saying: 'What do you know about them, who are they and where are they coming from?' "The court heard that the cash payment was eventually made in a meeting at the Copthorne Tara Hotel in London, the covert filming of which was shown to the jury on Tuesday.The case continues.
