A registered childminder and scout leader has been jailed for three years for killing an 11-month-old baby by violently shaking her in a fit of temper.Keran Henderson, herself a mother-of-two, was in sole charge of baby Maeve Sheppard when she was rushed to hospital unconscious and critically ill with brain injuries in March 2005.Henderson was found guilty of manslaughter after an emotionally charged five-week trial at Reading crown court.Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Justice Keith, said: "Mr and Mrs Sheppard trusted you to look after Maeve."We do not know what really happened to make you snap in the way the jury found that you did."The court heard that on the morning of March 2 2005, emergency services were called and rushed the baby to hospital.Doctors fought to save her but her condition deteriorated. Her life support machine was turned off two days later after a short christening ceremony.Medical experts for the crown told the jury that violent shaking alone could have caused Maeve's injuries.Her neck ligaments were "overextended", indicating that her neck had snapped back and forth.Henderson, 43, had seven years experience running her childminding business from her home at Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire.She was hired by Maeve's parents, Ruth and Mark, in January 2005.After Maeve's death, Henderson claimed the baby had a seizure while she was changing her nappy.Expert witnesses for the defence said the injuries could have been days, weeks or even months old.Henderson claimed the baby had been repeatedly ill since she was first in her care, which her parents denied.She claimed that, on the day she died, Maeve's body had "stiffened and jerked back" as she changed her nappy, her eyes rolled back into her head, her body went floppy and she was gurgling as if something was stuck in her throat.But the jury rejected her story, agreeing with the prosecution that Henderson violently shook Maeve, causing the child's death.She collapsed as the verdict was read out, sobbing uncontrollably and having to be helped from the dock by a dock officer.Her cries were audible in the courtroom as the judge adjourned the court, saying: "I don't think it is appropriate to proceed for the time being."I want to give her a chance to compose herself. I want her to have the opportunity to make an informed decision on whether she is to be present for the last part of the trial."Henderson's family in the public gallery reacted angrily to the verdict.The manslaughter sentence was a huge fall from grace for a woman who, even the prosecution conceded, was "good with children" and had devoted herself to community life.Married to her childhood sweetheart, Iain, Henderson had moved to Iver Heath many years earlier and taken over the local beaver scout branch as leader.She quickly increased the 1st Iver Heath scout group to include more than 40 boys. Its popularity meant she had to run two meetings in an evening to give all the boys a chance to attend.She helped younger members of a local drama group and passed a minibus-driving test to take the scouts on trips.Her husband told the court his wife was dedicated to working with children.He said: "Keran's life over the past 12 years has been focused all around [upon] children."She is such a caring, loving person, and that love is shared around with friends and family, her precious children and those in her care."A former Royal Parks police officer, Mr Henderson set up a carers4carers website, which has been filled with messages of support from the many children his wife had looked after and their parents.He also wrote to the court that he and his wife were deeply concerned about the "rash and ill-advised" prosecutions of people caring for children and said he intended to campaign to raise awareness of the plight of carers falsely accused.His wife suspended her role in all of her community activities and stopped work as a childminder not long after Maeve's death.But she said the death had shaken her. She said: "I wasn't able to look after the children. I was basically curled up in a ball on the settee, shaking and crying, in total shock."The court heard that Ruth Sheppard had enjoyed a good relationship with her daughter's childminder before Maeve's death.A local nursery leader had recommended Henderson to Sheppard and the two women got on well when they first met at Henderson's home.Henderson fought back tears as Maeve's mother described how she warmed to her daughter's childminder."I was quite happy with the arrangements. It was a very well-ordered house; she had a schedule and a routine, it was clean and tidy and we got on very well."On the day that Maeve was taken to hospital with catastrophic brain injuries she comforted a "hysterical" Henderson."I think I gave her a hug and told her it was all going to be OK."After the hearing, police issued a statement on behalf of Maeve's parents.The family wrote: "Even though Keran Henderson was found guilty today, no sentence will ever bring back our daughter and we will never be able to forgive this woman for what she took away from us."We would like to say we feel no animosity towards Keran's husband and children. We have lost a life for life; they will have their family back together in three years."We carried out the relevant checks to make sure Keran was a good, trustworthy childminder and our gut instinct was to trust her. It was purely a professional relationship and if only she had told us that it was not working out between her and Maeve, then we would have our baby daughter with us today."The Sheppards, who have two other children, said: "Now the trial has finally come to an end, we can start to think about moving on with our lives - but nothing can bring back our baby that we loved with all our hearts."
