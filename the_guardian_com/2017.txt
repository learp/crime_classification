An 86-year-old man has become the oldest person in Britain to be served with an anti-social behaviour order.Alexander Muat, a pensioner from Huyton, near Liverpool, is accused by 11 of his neighbours of having made their lives a misery for the past seven years. He is accused of following them in the street, shouting abuse and filming them, as well as playing the television too loudly and banging windows, his garage door and the lid of his dustbin. Mr Muat, who is hard of hearing, denies the allegations: "I have done nothing wrong. I am just trying to get on with my life in peace." Knowsley magistrates court, Merseyside, served an interim anti-social behaviour order on Mr Muat on Friday. Merseyside police will request a full order to the court on July 7. Breaching an order is a criminal offence carrying a maximum five-year prison sentence. Anti-social behaviour orders were introduced in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to clamp down on people, mainly youths, who persistently harass others with abusive and disruptive behaviour.
