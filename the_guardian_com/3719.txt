Institutional racism still blights the policing of black and minority ethnic communities six years after the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report, says Home Office research published yesterday.The study by the London School of Economics Mannheim Centre for Criminology found there had been "substantial and positive changes" in policing. These included improving police response to hate crime, managing murder investigations, liaising with local communities and excising racist language from the service.But the criminologists said progress had been confined to changes that were "most obviously identifiable and achievable", with the result that the institutional racism identified by the Lawrence inquiry in 1999 still remained to be understood and tackled by the police.The study found that the police had been successful in eliminating racist language among staff - a marked change to the climate within the force as little as 10 years ago. But the research, which included a national survey of police officers, also found that women and minority staff believed the change in language was largely cosmetic.Consultations with minority communities had improved, but the study said there were continuing difficulties in routine police working practices that stemmed from a failure to recognise differences in the way the police were seen in different communities.Inappropriate or poor service by individual officers was often perceived as racist, and minority ethnic groups still expected to be discriminated against.The study, carried out between 2002 and 2004, found police officers overwhelmingly believed the service had improved since the Lawrence inquiry and that their dealings with minority ethnic groups were under much greater scrutiny.Â· Assessing the impact of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, Home Office research study 294.www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds
