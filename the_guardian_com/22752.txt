An 83-year-old woman with a history of mental illness and violence was sent indefinitely to a secure hospital yesterday for battering a fellow care home resident to death with an old-fashioned iron.May Thrower beat Olive Garvie, 93, at least a dozen times with the iron after creeping into her room at the Coniscliffe residential home late at night in February 2004. Psychiatrists who examined Thrower after the attack found she was suffering from personality disorders involving "paranoid, schizoid or dissocial features". But staff at the care home in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, had no idea of her condition because her medical records were lost before she moved there. Thrower was charged with murder after the prolonged attack on Miss Garvie, but a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted yesterday at Newcastle crown court. It emerged that Thrower had spent 14 years in hospitals during the 1950s and 1960s and was suffering from a psychopathic disorder at the time of the attack. In 1994, she attacked a neighbour with a chair leg and was put on probation for two years. Toby Hedworth QC, prosecuting, said staff at the home were unaware of Thrower's mental history and had believed she was of sound mind. "Regrettably, how wrong that understanding turned out to be," he said. Judge David Hobson ordered Thrower to be treated indefinitely at a secure unit.
