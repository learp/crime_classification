Some newspapers covering the death of three-year-old Mikaeel Kular have been tempted into territory that would appear to take them very close to contempt of court.Soon after the boy's body was found, his mother, Rosdeep, was detained for questioning. The resulting articles about her in some Sunday titles contained speculation about her character that might be said to be prejudicial.But they are unlikely to face legal action because the articles ran in England rather than Scotland, where Mrs Kular - now charged in connection with the death of her son - faces a potential trial.It was noticeable that the Scottish edition of the Sun on Sunday (SoS) handled the story very differently from its English editions. Similarly, an arguably actionable article in the English Mail on Sunday (MoS) was not carried in its Scottish edition.I cannot show the difference, however, just as I cannot repeat headlines and excerpts from the English and Welsh editions without facing a legal problem myself because this blog can be accessed in Scotland. When I first read yesterday's English editions of SoS, MoS and the Daily Star Sunday, I thought they had forgotten the painful lessons of the character assassination of Christopher Jefferies. He was the innocent man arrested in 2010 during the hunt for the murderer of his tenant, Joanna Yeates, and then suffered from a press rush to judgment. (He explored that sad business in a Radio 4 programme, A life less ordinary, on Saturday).But, of course, Scotland is a separate jurisdiction. So the editors of London-based national newspapers, as long as their editions did not cross the border, can argue that their articles cannot possibly be prejudicial.I note that The Sun was careful not to put its most contentious article up online. Mail Online, by contrast, does appear to be carrying the story it ran only in its English edition. Perhaps its lawyers should reconsider that decision.Despite fulfilling the letter of the law in terms of contempt, I still wonder whether it was wise of editors to push at the boundaries - ethical, legal and geographical - before we discovered the exact charge against Mrs Kular.Then again, as they might well point out, with some validity, they were only repeating what was available to anyone - including people in Scotland - who clicked on to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.There is no sense in which any paper strayed into the libellous areas that resulted in the appalling coverage of Mr Jefferies.
