Firefighters found Mrs Fox dead in the same room from which her son escaped.She had eight other children aged between 20 and their mid-30s.In an earlier statement, her family said: "Our mum devoted her life to us her nine children and went without herself to provide the best that she could for us."She was at times, shall we say, eccentric, she had a sense of humour and was loving and caring."She never did anything to hurt anyone and never would. She would give her last penny to help those in less fortunate circumstances than herself."
