A scheme to help prisoners apply for bank accounts before they are released has been launched by the Co-operative Bank.The bank said money laundering rules made it difficult for prisoners to open an account before they left jail because they lacked the paperwork required by many financial institutions.Even prisoners who had only been in jail for a few months may lack the recent utility bills requested by most banks and building societies as proof of address.As a result, the Co-op said they left prison without an account, which could hamper the search for a job or a home.A pilot scheme at the category B Forest Bank prison in Greater Manchester will allow prison staff to confirm the applicant's identity and address.Applicants who are approved will get a basic bank account offering access to direct debits and ATM withdrawals, but no credit facility. Chris Smith, head of community and campaigns at Co-op bank, said it was not taking a risk by relaxing the rules. "We can prove where they've been for some time," he said."The money laundering regulations mean that a letter from the governor or an interview with the prisoner should be sufficient to prove who they are."Mr Smith said the scheme, which would be open only to those about to finish their sentence, would make it easier for prisoners to resume normal life. "If you go for a job you will be asked for your bank details and it can be off-putting to an employer if you don't have an account - there is a stigma attached to it," he said. "This removes some of the barriers and the stigma."Rob Woolley, the bank's director of customer services, added: "We understand that access to employment and housing are extremely important factors in reducing the risk of re-offending, but these can only be obtained if ex-offenders have bank accounts."Brian Capon, spokesman for the British Bankers' Association, said he was not aware of any other bank that was catering for prisoners in this way, but there was no reason why other institutions could not consider applications from prisoners."It's very much down to the individual bank to decide what documentation is sufficient to prove to the regulator that it has done the money laundering checks," he said. A spokesman for Alliance & Leicester said the bank would not rule someone out purely because they had been in prison, but potential customers would have to fulfil the bank's standard criteria for proving their identity.
