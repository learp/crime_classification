One of the two men accused of attempting to blackmail a member of the royal family over gay sex allegations today claimed he was entrapped in order to protect a multi-million pound business deal.Ian Strachan, 31, claimed a friend of the royal tried to convince him to accept £50,000 for a series of videotapes allegedly containing proof of the sexual impropriety.The friend told Strachan he wanted to buy the copyright to the material relating to the royal, known as witness A, in a "perfectly legitimate business deal".It was then agreed that Strachan and his co-defendant, Sean McGuigan, would meet the man, known only as witness C, in France to complete the transaction, the Old Bailey jury heard.Mark Ellison QC, prosecuting, questioned Strachan about the details of the transaction. Strachan replied: "I don't think there was any prospect of it. He [witness C] was planning to entrap us in France ... to avoid a scandal."He stood to profit by many millions of pounds with A from a business deal." No further details of the business deal were disclosed.Ellison asked Strachan if he felt he was being entrapped. "That is what it seems like to me, to be quite honest," Strachan replied.Strachan, of Fulham, south-west London, and McGuigan, 41, of Battersea, south London, both deny making an unwarranted demand with menaces of £50,000.The court has heard that the pair recorded tapes of a royal employee, known as witness D, in which D claimed that the royal had performed a sex act on him. It is alleged that the pair then tried to extort £50,000 from A, having failed to sell the tapes to newspapers.Both men were arrested in an undercover police sting operation at a London hotel in September last year.Today, Strachan was asked what the motivation was for going to the press, if it was not money. He replied: "D was planning on going to the press himself and I thought we would steal his thunder, expose him in the way he was thinking about exposing A and other members of the royal family in a much more sensational way."The trial continues.
