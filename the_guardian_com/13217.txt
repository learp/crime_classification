Two senior Sussex police officers have been disciplined after a misconduct tribunal yesterday upheld complaints about their bungled investigation of a racist killing in Brighton in 1999.Jay Abatan, 42, from Eastbourne, died after being attacked outside the Ocean Rooms nightclub. He was in a coma for five days before his life support machine was switched off. Graham Curtis, 41, and Peter Bell, 39, were arrested within 24 hours but manslaughter charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Instead, they were charged with affray and actual bodily harm, but acquitted on both charges. Curtis hanged himself two years ago. The Independent Police Complaints Commission ordered a superintendent and two detective inspectors from Sussex police to appear before a disciplinary tribunal after two reports, by Essex police and Avon and Somerset constabulary, castigated Sussex for not taking Mr Abatan's death sufficiently seriously and ignoring important witnesses. The superintendent accepted the five charges put to him earlier this year, and yesterday the misconduct tribunal, chaired by Metropolitan police commander Sue Wilkinson, upheld several charges of failures in duty against the two detective inspectors. One received two cautions, the other a formal reprimand. David Petch, IPCC commissioner for Sussex, welcomed deputy chief constable Joe Edwards's offer to meet the Abatan family, give them an account of the investigation, and explain improvements made since.
