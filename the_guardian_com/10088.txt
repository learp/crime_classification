Raffles, the suave thief who sipped cocktails with the upper classes before stealing their jewellery, was the fictional creation of EW Hornung.But Paddington police believe a real "gentleman thief" may be robbing a block of flats in one of London's smartest postal districts. They believe that a well dressed, clean-shaven man seen in CCTV footage could have stolen jewellery worth more than £100,000 from Porchester Terrace, Bayswater. Necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, watches and sunglasses have been stolen . One collection, stolen on February 7 and consisting of a yellow metal necklace, white and yellow earrings and a white metal ring, all set with diamonds, pearls and peridots, made by an Italian designer, is valued at £50,000 It is reported to belong to the Russian oil consultant Elena Badamiants, who has lived there for five years. Police suspect the same thief was also responsible for the theft of a handbag and a purse containing chequebooks and credit cards from another flat in the block on February 3. The thief returned to the building at the weekend but fled empty-handed. Detective Chief Inspector Martin Johnson said Paddington burglary squad had been unable to identify the man seen on CCTV entering and leaving the building as a resident or friend or otherwise having access, but many residents were business people "who come and go". "All we're looking to do is identify him, interview him about the matter and eliminate him from our enquiries." Ms Badamiants told the London Evening Standard: "Obviously [the thief] is a very cold-hearted person."
