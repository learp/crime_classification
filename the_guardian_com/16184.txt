Police in Leeds are hoping to prevent an outbreak of internet-enabled mayhem after thousands were invited to a public pillow fight through Facebook.Worried residents of the Hyde Park area contacted the city council and West Yorkshire police when they learned of the proposed pillow bashing, which is scheduled to take place on May 25. Police have contacted the apparent organiser in the hope of preventing the "flash" event from getting out of hand. Earlier this month, an award-winning park in the city was damaged when 350 people gathered for a water fight, which was also organised through social networking websites. A police spokesman said yesterday: "We have contacted the alleged organiser regarding this event and advised him to cancel it. We will be monitoring the situation to ensure that it does not take place. Any such events, especially those potentially involving large numbers of people, must be given the proper licence by the council in advance."He added: "While such an event may seem like a bit of fun, it is easy to see how a mass pillow fight could get out of hand and potentially cause our officers a significant amount of work."Thousands of pounds worth of damage was inflicted on the city's Millennium Square Garden during the water fight on the May Day bank holiday. Plants and turf were torn up and the central fountain was damaged. The student organisers tried to impose limits on the fray, banning water balloons and warning participants not to attack "civilians", but the rampage soon spread to surrounding streets. Police later examined CCTV images of the uproar, as well as footage posted on Facebook and YouTube.
