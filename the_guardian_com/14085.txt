There are reports of debris landing on top of buildings."There were police officers in the area at time. We are not entirely sure what happened, and we are just being very careful."Yates said officers were carrying out routine policing in the area at the time but there were "sensitivities" surrounding what they were doing."It is a confusing picture as to what exactly happened.

Anybody that saw anything suspicious can help us," he said.Police said Fountain Hill, Spencer Road and minor roads between Chapel Road and Spencer Road would remain closed on Wednesday to allow for daylight searches.
