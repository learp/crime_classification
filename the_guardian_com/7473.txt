A man whose pitbull attacked five police officers has been convicted of owning a dog dangerously out of control in a public place.Symieon Robinson-Pierre, 25, was found guilty of three charges under the Dangerous Dogs Act during a hearing at London crown court.The officers fled when the dog attacked them as they tried to raid Robinson-Pierre's home in Newham, east London, on 22 March. The dog was shot four times by an armed police officer after five colleagues attempted to subdue it without success.A jury of seven men and five women reached a unanimous verdict, finding Robinson-Pierre guilty over the injuries to PCs Paul Garrard, Lee Bush and Steve Bones. He was previously cleared of a fourth charge when it was ruled that the attack on PC Marc Merritt took place in the garden of Robinson-Pierre's home, which is private property, not a public place. The attack on the fifth police officer, PC Martin Corderoy, took place in the garden and was not the subject of a charge.Robinson-Pierre also admitted a charge of owning a fighting dog. He was remanded in custody until sentencing on 17 September.
