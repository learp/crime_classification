Ministers unveiled sweeping legislation yesterday containing measures to allow widespread data sharing between public and private sectors for the first time in the name of tackling fraud.The serious crime bill, which also proposes so-called "super Asbos" to target criminal masterminds, will allow public and private sector anti-fraud agencies to access personal financial information, including pay, tax, pension and benefit records held across the public sector.The legislation follows a decision by the cabinet last summer to overturn the basic data protection principle that personal information provided to a government department for one purpose should in general not be used for another. Instead ministers have reversed the principle so "information will normally be shared in the public sector, provided it is in the public interest".The bill clears the way for data matching exercises to be carried out on a large scale, even though a Home Office consultation paper last year acknowledged many public bodies feared such operations were seen as "fishing expeditions" which should only be justified on a "crime by crime" basis. But the bill will open the way for operations under which software is used to search several databases to identify suspicious patterns of activity that cannot be spotted when the data is seen individually.The legislation specifically excludes sensitive personal data, such as NHS patient records, from its provisions.But it gives the home secretary the power to add to the purposes for which data matching exercises can be carried out, including the prevention of crime other than fraud, the apprehension of offenders or the recovery of debt. It acknowledges that this might include sensitive personal data in the future.The explanatory notes with the bill also make clear that, in the longer term, the national fraud initiative, in which 1,300 public bodies take part, will be extended to include information on central government systems, such as passports and driving licences.This could pave the way for the addition of the national identity register and widespread data sharing across Whitehall.A recent pilot scheme carried out between the student loan company and the Home Office's immigration and nationality directorate demonstrated a high level of matches between those fraudulently applying for student loans and those without indefinite leave to remain or permission to study in the UK.The Audit Commission is to be given mandatory powers to carry out data matching exercises in local government to tackle fraud but participation is to be voluntary at this stage for individual Whitehall government departments .Ministers said yesterday data sharing could help private sector initiatives funded by the banks to tackle credit card fraud, which would benefit from being able to carry out data matching exercises with several public sector databases.The bill contains safeguards to ensure that confidentiality is protected with the threat of imprisonment used for the first time in heavier penalties to punish wrongful disclosures of data. Ministers say this will help increase the willingness of the public to share personal data "in the interests of legitimate activity including efficient government".The human rights group, Liberty, said data matching powers would allow "fishing expeditions" against private bodies and companies without needing to be be based on suspicion or intelligence.The super Asbos are expected to be used about 30 times a year, at an average cost of Â£40,000 a time. The serious crime prevention orders target people suspected of being involved in money laundering, fraud, drugs and human trafficking.The orders will be accompanied by offences of encouraging or assisting another person to commit a crime, that will be targeted at alleged serious crime bosses who stay behind the scenes and use others to do their dirty work.The legislation also contains powers to abolish the assets recovery agency and merge its operation with the serious organised crime agency. The assets recovery agency has faced repeated legal challenges from lawyers of those it targeted.The government hopes the super Asbos will disable criminal masterminds but the civil orders, which carry a five-year prison term for breaches, may be subject to human rights challenges.
