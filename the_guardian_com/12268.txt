London residents can see how much crime is being committed in their neighbourhood on a new website launched today.The Â£210,000 project shows robbery, burglary and car-crime statistics for the capital. Crime maps were a key manifesto pledge of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, who said today that the site would be "hugely beneficial" and would help reduce crime by putting public pressure on the police.Users can type in their postcode and zoom in to see statistics for their local area.The site also compares levels between London boroughs, with higher-crime areas shown in red and lower-crime areas in blue.It reveals at a glance that Richmond has below average crime rates, while Westminster is a crime hot spot, probably due to its high density of tourists and visitors.Speaking at a press conference in City Hall, the mayor said he hoped that the website would "reconnect" people to their experiences and encourage them to record and report crime. The online service will provide contact details of local police officers. Johnson said: "What we want to see is Londoners feeling that if they experience crime that it matters, that it is not going to be lost in some great welter of statistics, that it's going to be recorded on the spot where it happened, that it's going to be publicly available and there's going to be pressure on the police to do something about it." Sir Paul Stephenson, deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said that pressure would not just be put on the police but on other agencies who need to play a part.Stephenson told the press conference that the site could be expanded in the future to include other types of crime, clean-up rates and local crime-fighting plans. He said that Londoners' perception of crime was often "higher than the reality" and that the maps might help to reassure communities about the general safety in their area.Stephenson said he hoped the information available would help "energise" and engage people to get involved in finding solutions to tackling local crime problems with the police. He said: "There has been a growing and understandable appetite for people to know more about what crime is happening in their local areas. "We've deliberately made these new crime maps as easily accessible and user friendly as possible with the aim of increasing communication and trust between the public and police."
