The family of Robert McCartney came face to face yesterday with the man charged with the murder of their brother.Mr McCartney's fiancee and five sisters sat in a packed public gallery at Belfast Magistrates' Court as Terence Davison was brought into the dock. Davison, 49, is accused of killing the father-of-two outside Magennis's Bar near the Markets area in south Belfast on 30 January. A second man, 36-year-old James McCormick, also appeared in court charged with the attempted murder of Brendan Devine, who was with Mr McCartney on the night of the murder. Davison, of Stanfield Place in the Markets area, denies murder. McCormick, who was arrested on Victoria Road, Stechford, in Birmingham, but is originally from the Markets area, denies the attempted murder of Mr Devine. Magistrate Harry McKibbin remanded both men in custody and ordered them to reappear via video link on 1 July. Speaking outside the Laganside Courthouse after the 15-minute hearing, Paula McCartney said: 'The family is relieved that the first step in a very long process is over. We vehemently believe that everyone is entitled to a fair trial. We hope that is what is going to happen here and it will be found out in the courtroom who is guilty and who isn't.' Asked how she felt when she set eyes on the accused, Ms McCartney said: 'Nauseated would be the word. But we are just glad that it has arrived here.'
