A police laboratory worker wrote the wrong case number on a form relating to one of the men accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence, a court has heard.Yvonne Turner, a forensic assistant, admitted she "wasn't concentrating" when she started examining a jacket belonging to Gary Dobson.On 28 October 1993, Turner had been asked to look at a woolly hat and a baseball cap, linked to a separate robbery case, as well as Dobson's jacket.The Old Bailey heard that she wrote the case number linked to the robbery at the top of the form for the jacket.She told the court: "I wasn't concentrating and I wasn't focused at the stage when I wrote the case number in, but I've clearly got to grips with the case as I've written the correct item number."Dobson, 36, and 35-year-old David Norris, both of south London, are accused of murdering Lawrence â€“ a charge they deny.Turner also gave a detailed account of the tests for blood and fibres that she carried out on the Raiders jacket Lawrence was wearing on the night he died. Working at a laboratory in Lambeth, south London, she noted bloodstains and stab holes in the fabric.Earlier, the court was told that exhibits relating to five people originally suspected of the murder were stored in the same room, at Eltham police station, in which Lawrence's clothing had previously been kept.Clothes belonging to Dobson, Norris and two other men not on trial, Neil and Jamie Acourt, were all stored in the disused cell. Some belonging to a fifth, unnamed suspect were also kept there later, the court heard.The exhibits officer, Detective Constable Robert Crane, was asked if the suspects' items could have been kept in the same area where Lawrence's clothes had been days before. He said: "I think not. In any event, every item has gone into that cell sealed."The jury also passed around a police evidence bag to see that it was made from a double layer of paper.The case continues.
