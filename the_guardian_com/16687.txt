A 23-year-old man was yesterday given 30 months in jail for kidnapping his ex-girlfriend. She was held with bound hands, feet and mouth, in a makeshift dungeon. Wolverhampton crown court heard that in February Tony Boden locked Katie Peters, 18, in a cellar under the music shop he ran in Bilston, West Midlands. Boden, an Elvis impersonator, handcuffed her, helped by Sarah Marshall, 21, and led her to the unlit room. He made missing person posters, but Peters was discovered 42 hours later after Marshall set off the shop alarm. Marshall has pleaded guilty to false imprisonment.
