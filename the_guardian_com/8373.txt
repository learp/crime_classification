A forensic investigation is under way after a human head was found in a field in Leicestershire yesterday.The discovery was made in Asfordby and comes days after a severed leg and arm were found in two locations nearly 100 miles away in Hertfordshire.It is not clear yet whether the head is from a man or a woman.Detective Superintendent Julia McKechnie of Leicestershire police said: "Our main priority in the initial stages is to determine the identity of the person involved. This will largely be determined by the forensic investigations, which could take some days to complete."In the meantime, we're looking into the circumstances surrounding the discovery but are keeping an open mind as to why and how the head came to be in the field."It is too early to confirm whether it is linked to any crime or investigation being undertaken by colleagues in other forces but we are naturally liaising with other forces as you would expect in an inquiry of this nature."Last night, Hertfordshire police said tests on the arm and leg showed they were from the same man. He is believed to have been white or Asian and between 5ft 6in (167cm) and 5ft 10in (178cm) tall. His DNA profile did not match any held on the national DNA database.A spokeswoman for Hertfordshire police confirmed that detectives were liaising with officers from Leicestershire over the investigation.Hertfordshire police opened a murder inquiry two weeks ago when the leg was found in a green holdall on the side of the A507 in the village of Cottered. The arm was discovered on Sunday on farmland in nearby Wheathampstead.
