A man with a history of violence was jailed for life today after he was convicted of murdering his girlfriend.Ricardo Morrison, 22, stabbed 19-year-old Amy Barnes to death after subjecting her to nine months of violence during their turbulent relationship.It emerged that Morrison had four previous convictions for assault and one for harassing an ex-girlfriend.Ms Barnes, who was a fashion and drama student, was fatally stabbed last November at her grandmother's house in Farnworth, near Bolton, where she was living with Morrison, a football coach. Moments after the attack she made a desperate 999 call.She told the operator: "He's stabbed me to death â€¦ my boyfriend, please help me. I can't breathe. I've been stabbed. I'm dying."Ms Barnes's mother, Karyn Killiner, 41, a teacher, said Morrison had wormed his way into the family's affections after meeting her daughter."I want the world to know what he is like," she said. "He was a conman and he integrated himself in our family. He was charming and said how much he loves you. But the other side of him is controlling and he had complete power over Amy and all her actions. He is an absolute monster and no language can describe him."Detective Chief Inspector Andy Peach, of Greater Manchester police, said: "This was a brutal murder. Morrison repeatedly stabbed the person he was supposed to love, causing the horrific injuries that ultimately led to her death."We don't think it is the first time Morrison hurt Amy. I hope this encourages anyone who is a victim of domestic abuse to speak out."
