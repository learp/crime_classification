Tony Blair stepped up his drive to restore a culture of respect in Britain yesterday with a raft of new summary justice powers that would extend compulsory parenting programmes and put the worst problem families into a national network of "sinbins".The prime minister's third term push to deal with yob culture would impose financial sanctions, including cuts to housing benefit, on evicted problem families who refused to cooperate with compulsory rehabilitation programmes.The Respect "action plan" published yesterday also includes the power to evict for the first time antisocial private householders, as well as social housing tenants. The police would be able to use existing powers to "shut and seal" homes for up to three months.The Conservatives accused Mr Blair of "one-dimensional knee-jerk populism" while the Liberal Democrats called the measures a "mish-mash of gimmicks". Children's groups said the plan was a rehash of existing policies.Justifying the need for the proposals, Mr Blair condemned the criminal justice system as "utterly useless" in protecting the public from low-level disorder.His father, who grew up in the back streets of 1930s Glasgow, would have been shocked by the lack of respect shown in Britain today, he claimed. Mr Blair clearly wants a further clampdown on antisocial behaviour to be part of the process of securing his legacy at No 10 Downing Street.Beneath the tough talk, however, lay a major extension in parenting programmes, with parenting orders to be made available for those who seriously misbehave in school and new intervention schemes for those who truant or have already been excluded.Sixteen ministers toured the country yesterday pushing the agenda, which has been the subject of intense Whitehall negotiations overseen by the Home Office minister Hazel Blears and the PM's Respect "tsar", Louise Casey.The Home Office said that £80m would be made available over the next two years to fund the Respect programme of work, but social services directors last night warned that this figure was dwarfed by a £600m funding shortfall in children's services over the next financial year. Andrew Webb, co-chair of the Association of Directors of Social Services' children and families committee, said many councils were facing "radical cuts" in family support services.Mr Blair has responded to criticism that evicting antisocial tenants was simply kicking the problem around the country by creating a national network of intensive family support schemes, with the first 50 up and running by the end of this year at a cost of £28m.Disruptive families would be expected to sign up to a strict behaviour code in return for 24-hour professional counselling and family support.Problem families who faced eviction or their children being taken into care would qualify to be sent on intensive family support schemes modelled on a project running in Dundee which claims an 84% success rate. Some families would have to live in dedicated "secure" accommodation for up to 12 months as part of the scheme; 0thers may be allowed to stay in their own homes.Children's welfare organisations and probation officers welcomed early intervention schemes but warned that compulsory parenting orders and the eviction of extremely difficult families would not tackle the real problems.Bob Reitemeier, Children's Society chief executive, said the plan failed to offer anything more than "a cocktail of policies that have already been launched" mixed with shock tactics such as shutting and sealing families out of their own homes."Providing high quality, accessible support and services for all families would make the biggest difference. If the government wants to get more respect from young people it also needs to show greater respect for them and their rights," he said.The Conservative leader, David Cameron also said that Mr Blair's "recycled crackdowns" missed the point and he put forward his own plans for social enterprise zones and a national school leaver programme. "The real respect agenda must include long-term solutions to the causes of social breakdown, not just short-term sanctions and punishment," he said.The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten agreed that tackling antisocial behaviour was a huge challenge, but said it not be achieved "with this government's usual mish-mash of gimmicks and spin".
