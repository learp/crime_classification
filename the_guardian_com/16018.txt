An inquiry by the police watchdog into events linked to the "completely senseless" random murder of a gap-year student is under way. Kieran Crump Raiswell, 18, was stabbed in the chest four times without warning by total stranger Imran Hussain, 27, in the street in Whalley Range, Manchester.Witnesses saw Hussain laughing as he ran back to his car and drove to his flat in Coventry. His victim died later the same day in hospital. The attack on 16 January took place 12 days after the defendant had driven to Nottingham and punched a man outside his workplace before he again ran off to his vehicle. The Nottingham victim made a note of his registration number and spoke to police, but Hussain remained undetected as he travelled to Manchester.Hussain was today found guilty of Kieran's murder, which he had denied.Crump Raiswell had been accepted to study history at Sheffield Hallam University later this year. His mother, Christine, 45, said: "It is so completely senseless."
