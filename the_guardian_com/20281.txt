Two men have been arrested for allegedly tweeting remarks inciting racial or religious hatred following the murder of a soldier in Woolwich, south-east London.Police made the arrests in Bristol in the early hours of Thursday, just hours after the death of Drummer Lee Rigby.Complaints were made to the Avon and Somerset force about remarks that appeared on Twitter.A 23-year-old and a 22-year-old, both from Bristol, were held under the Public Order Act on suspicion of inciting racial or religious hatred.Detective Inspector Ed Yaxley said: "On Wednesday evening, we were contacted by people concerned about comments made on social media accounts."He added: "These comments were directed against a section of our community. Comments such as these are completely unacceptable and only cause more harm to our community in Bristol."People should stop and think about what they say on social media before making statements as the consequences could be serious."Police confirmed on Friday that the two men were later released on bail pending further inquiries.
