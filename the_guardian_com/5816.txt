The number of prisoners in England and Wales has been reduced by 1,500 since emergency measures were introduced to ease the overcrowding crisis, it was revealed today.A Prison Service spokeswoman was unable to say how many of the 1,500 were 'early release' prisoners - "non-dangerous" offenders allowed to leave up to 18 days before the end of their sentences - or how much of the decline was caused by other fluctuations.The number of inmates fell to 79,543, down from last Friday's record high of 81,040.For the first time since early April, no offenders are being held in overspill cells in police stations or courts.The spokeswoman said: "We have not given a commitment to reveal on a weekly basis how many prisoners are freed under the early release provisions."Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the prison population would only drop back to a "sensible level" when ministers were able to "put in place court diversion schemes for the mentally ill, proper provision for vulnerable children and women, treatment for addicts, and community service for the 50,000 people a year who serve sentences of less than six months".Mark Leech, the editor of the Prisons Handbook, said: "I do not think we can take much encouragement from this. I think it is a blip in what is an endless spiral in the prison population."The reality is that many of those released in the last week will be finding themselves back in prison within a very short period of time because of breach of licence conditions and an overstretched probation service."
