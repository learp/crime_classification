The home secretary, David Blunkett, was forced on to the defensive yesterday by a Conservative claim that he had snubbed the Queen by planning to rename the Crown Prosecution Service.The solicitor general, Harriet Harman, was called to the Commons to explain the government's ideas for a new-look service. Conservatives linked the change of name to weekend reports that the prisons were about to drop their royal connection as amounting to evidence of a republican agenda. The Home Office denied that the impending amalgamation of the prison and probation services would lead to them losing their crown status. "All prisons, whether public or privately run, will continue to be known as Her Majesty's prison ... Prison officers will continue to be civil servants with a continued allegiance to the crown," a prison service spokesman said. The row began after Mr Blunkett confirmed, in response to a question at a police conference, that the government was thinking of dropping the "crown" from the CPS. Royalist Conservatives said the government was tearing up long-standing historical traditions. Downing Street said the idea of renaming the CPS had been floated first by the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, in January last year, by Mr Blunkett last June, and by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken MacDonald, as recently as two weeks ago. Buckingham Palace had been aware of the idea and was now being formally consulted, it said.
