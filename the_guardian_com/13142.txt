Detectives investigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence gathered evidence that two of the main suspects bragged of their involvement in the racist attack that killed the talented student, the Guardian has learned.But despite that and other evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service yesterday announced that a five-year police reinvestigation had not produced a strong enough case to prosecute anyone for the 1993 murder at a south-east London bus stop.Scotland Yard will now stop actively pursuing the case, which shamed the force after it was revealed detectives had made errors and missed evidence in the crucial days after Lawrence, 18, was stabbed.Doreen Lawrence, who has battled for 11 years to hold the police to account, said yesterday her son's murderers would have been behind bars had he been white.The family believes police racism helped the murderers get away with their crime.Mrs Lawrence said the blame lay with the Met's original bungling, which a public inquiry found was caused by incompetence and institutional racism: "The failure of the police to properly investigate in 1993 has directly led us to the position we are in today."For the last two years the CPS decision has been described as imminent.Mrs Lawrence said: "I am angry it has taken such a long time to reach this conclusion. The authorities have given up. I have not and will not abandon the fight for justice in my son's name."After the murder five main suspects were repeatedly named to police. All deny any involvement. The Guardian has learned that seven people were investigated for the attack, including two new suspects.Detectives obtained evidence that at least two suspects had made admissions to friends that they had been involved, but the CPS ruled this was "hearsay" and inadmissible in court.One person said he had seen some of the suspects near the scene shortly after the stabbing. But this witnesses had consumed a large amount of alcohol, undermining the value in court of the account.Solicitor Imran Khan said the family would consider a legal challenge to the CPS's decision and private prosecutions: "What we hope is that the police file is not closed."He added: "Two years ago me and the police were very optimistic, now it's turned to nothing. I want to know what happened."The Met's deputy commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, said offi cers would no longer actively work on the case.The force had said it knew who murdered Lawrence, but yesterday Sir Ian said: "We may have very strong suspicion about who it is killed Stephen, but we do not at this stage have sufficient evidence."The CPS said there was no reliable new eyewitness or credible forensic evidence linking anyone to the stabbing of Lawrence, who suffered two knife wounds.Claire Ward, CPS London's special casework lawyer, said: "There is no reliable, admissible evidence which places any identifiable suspect at the murder scene."The only surviving victim of the attack, Duwayne Brooks, said: "This is a day of shame ... the police investigation was doomed from the start at the scene of the attack."In 2000 a sexual assault case brought against Mr Brooks was thrown out, evidence he said of continuing harassment by officers that saw him arrested six times without being convicted.His solicitor, Jane Deighton, said: "Racist thugs are celebrating their escape from justice. They remain a danger to the public."Police errors included failing to follow up leads that flooded in immediately after the killing.In 1996 the Lawrence family launched a private murder prosecution which ended in Neil Acourt, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight being acquitted.The two other prime suspects were Jamie Acourt, and David Norris. One of the new suspects in the attack identified by detectives was Darren Davies, Mr Norris's cousin.A covert video camera caught some of the suspects playing with knives and fantasising about committing violence against Asian and black people.Lawrence's murderers were heard by witnesses to shout "what, what nigger" before stabbing the A-level student.In 2002 Acourt and Norris were jailed for a racist attack on an off-duty black police officer, half a mile from where Lawrence was stabbed.Potential witnesses were scared into silence and intimidated. The Guardian has learned that one potential witness was intimidated while under police protection.In 2000, the Met paid Â£320,000 compensation to Doreen Lawrence and her husband Neville for the blunders.The case led to the Macpherson inquiry, which castigated the police and led to landmark reforms designed to eradicate police racism, and improve ethnic minority confidence.
