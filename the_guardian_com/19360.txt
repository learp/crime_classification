A 14-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of the schoolboy Leroy James, also 14, who was found with a single stab wound in a park in Enfield, north London on Wednesday.The accused teenager was also charged with the possession of an offensive weapon and will appear at Enfield magistrates court on Monday.The boy was arrested with a second teenager on suspicion of murder on Thursday. They were both questioned by police and the other boy, 15, was released on police bail and is due to return next month pending further inquiries.The victim's father, also called Leroy James, said his son "will forever be remembered" and that he was "just trying to keep sane" in the wake of his death.Leroy Jr, who supported Arsenal and wanted to be a footballer, was the youngest of 10 teenagers murdered in the capital this year. Horrified witnesses described him as "sweet", as his father said paramedics failed to revive him at the scene in Ponders End recreation ground.James, 41, said he was due to take his son to Jamaica to see his mother in December, and Leroy was looking forward to it. "He was a pretty quiet boy," he said. "He didn't really talk much."James, from Edmonton Green, said he last spoke to his son in the morning and that he found out about the attack when one of his son's friends called him. Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses to the incident, which they said took place when the park was "incredibly busy".A postmortem examination carried out in Haringey found that Leroy died from a single stab wound, Scotland Yard said. Anyone with information about the incident should call 020 8358 0400.
