Later this week will see the start of a legal action against police chiefs who have been accused of attempting to hide away their embarrassing secrets.Eight women who say that they were duped into having long-term relationships with undercover police officers are suing police chiefs. Two other women and one man have also launched a similar legal action.But senior officers at Scotland Yard have applied to have some of the cases heard in a little-known, secretive tribunal.Here's some background on the police's move. For articles about why the women are taking the legal action, see this, this and this.Today, the eight women, represented by Birnberg Peirce, have issued a statement criticising the police. They say :"The police cannot be permitted to hide behind the cloak of secrecy, when they have been guilty of one of the most intrusive and complete invasions of privacy that can be imagined.""The Investigatory Powers Tribunal exists for the sole purpose of maintaining secrecy; under its jurisdiction the case could proceed with the women denied access to and unable to challenge police evidence, and being powerless to appeal the tribunal's decisions.""Thus, the women, who have suffered a totally disproportionate, unnecessary and extremely damaging invasion of their privacy, may be denied access to justice by the very legislation which was purportedly designed to protect their rights."The hearing in the High Court is due to start on Wednesday. There will be a demonstration outside the High Court in support of the women on Wednesday and Thursday between 9.30 and 10.30.
