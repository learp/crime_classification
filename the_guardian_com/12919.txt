A 50-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the record £40m jewellery raid on a Mayfair store – but police stress he is not one of the two sharply dressed figures captured in CCTV images.The man was arrested outside a house in Ilford, Essex, on Monday, but has subsequently been bailed pending further inquiries. Police raids were made on a number of addresses yesterday but no further details have been released.The raid happened at Graffs jewellers in New Bond Street late last Thursday afternoon, when two smartly dressed men arrived in a black taxi and walked past security guards before pulling out handguns and grabbing 43 items with a value estimated at close to £40m, believed to be a UK record. The stolen pieces include diamond hoop earrings, a yellow diamond necklace and a platinum and diamond ring.They seized a woman member of staff and dragged her into the street with them to ensure their getaway before firing a warning shot at security staff.Their getaway was in a series of cars through some of the most expensive streets in London. The woman was released unharmed as they jumped into a blue BMW, which continued around the corner into Stafford Street and then Dover Street. A second shot was fired as they abandoned that car after crashing into a taxi. They are then believed to have switched to a silver Mercedes, before driving through Hay Hill and Berkeley Square into Farm Street, where some of the suspects got into a black vehicle, possibly a Ford Galaxy or a VW Sharan.The stolen jewellery is believed to have been passed to a motorcyclist who sped from the scene.Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace, of the Metropolitan police flying squad, described the men as "extremely dangerous", and urged anyone who recognised them, or knew the whereabouts of the jewellery – almost certainly destined to be broken up into less identifiable gemstones and bullion – to contact the police.Descriptions of the raiders, both thought to be in their 30s, with London accents, have been circulated to all ports and airports, but police believe the men may already have left the country.
