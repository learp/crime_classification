The government's policies on crime and not defence lawyers are to blame for soaring legal aid costs, according to research published yesterday by the legal services commission, which administers legal aid.Ministers' attempts to control the budget by squeezing lawyers' costs could put the quality of defence work at risk, the researchers warn.The legal aid bill for defendants in crown court cases rose 125% from 1995-6 to 2003-4. Ministers want to curb fees paid to lawyers and have set up a review to look at new ways of buying legal services to keep costs down.The criminal bar, which complains that its fees for crown court cases lasting up to 10 days have been frozen for eight years, is threatening strike action in September.But the research suggests that criminal defence lawyers are not to blame for rising costs. Richard Moorhead of Cardiff Law School and Ed Cape of the University of the West of England said their findings showed it was irresponsible for the government to blame the profession.Their report points to a series of government initiatives aimed at bringing more criminals to justice, with no evidence that the impact on legal aid was ever considered or costed. New developments in crime detection technology have also driven costs up.
