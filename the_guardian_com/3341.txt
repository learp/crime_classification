An investigation into how two serial offenders were free to kill London financier John Monckton was launched yesterday after it emerged that one was on bail and the other had been released from prison three months previously, just over halfway through his sentence.Serious failings of the probation service and other agencies will be examined by the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, who will head the inquiry set up by home secretary Charles Clarke after the conviction of Damien Hanson and Elliot White.It will look at the risk assessment carried out before the early release last August of Hanson, after serving seven years of a 12-year sentence for attempted murder. Three months later he and White, both 24, tricked their way into the Chelsea home of Mr Monckton and killed him during a meticulously planned but ultimately botched attempt to rob his wife. Mr Clarke said yesterday that the "tragic" case raised a number of questions about the release from prison and supervision in the community of Hanson and White.Hanson was convicted last Thursday of Mr Monckton's murder, the attempted murder of Mr Monckton's wife, Homeyra, and robbery. He planned the robbery and was obsessed with the very rich. White, who had pleaded guilty to robbery, was convicted of Mr Monckton's manslaughter last Friday and of wounding Mrs Monckton with intent yesterday. He had been cleared of murder and attempted murder. The pair are due to be sentenced on January 27 after psychiatric reports.An official assessment of Hanson had calculated that his chances of reoffending were 91%. White was on bail at the time of the robbery.
