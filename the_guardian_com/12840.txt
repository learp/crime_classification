A British police constable whose wife turned him in as an act of revenge after their marriage ended in "bitterness and antagonism" was yesterday jailed for two years for killing a man in Guyana 23 years ago.Michael Cheong, 43, was told by an Old Bailey judge, Paul Focke, that in sentencing him he had taken into account Sandra Cheong's motive.The judge said: "It seems that your wife acted partly or mainly out of revenge for what she believed she suffered. I will deal with you as leniently as possible."Cheong faces dismissal from Suffolk police. The court heard that in 1982, when the couple were living in Guyana, Mrs Cheong was walking along an isolated track one day when she was attacked by a 20-year-old petty thief, Brian Spencer.After robbing Mrs Cheong of her jewellery, Spencer tried to rape her sister, Jackie. When Cheong heard about the incident he set off in pursuit of Spencer in a vehicle and later shot him in the back as he tried to run away.At first the Guyanese authorities failed to prosecute him, but in 1984, with pressure for a trial mounting, Cheong, who was born in Guildford, Surrey, decided to leave Guyana and return to Britain. There he tried to put his past behind him, joining the army and later the prison service and the police.The court heard that at first Mrs Cheong had played the "dutiful and loyal wife", but as the years passed her loyalty to Cheong had become "increasingly strained"."By 2003 the marriage had irretrievably broken down, ending in bitterness and antagonism on both sides," said Mark Dennis, prosecuting. "It was that year that she approached Suffolk police and told them what had happened."After launching an investigation in the UK and South America, police charged Cheong, of Woodbridge, Suffolk, under an 1861 law that allows UK citizens to be prosecuted for murder or manslaughter committed anywhere in the world.Last month a jury cleared him of murder but found him guilty of manslaughter, which he had denied.After his conviction, Mrs Cheong, 43, admitted she had contacted police about the killing as an act of revenge after seeing her husband, whom she had met in Guyana at the age of 18, kissing another woman.Mrs Cheong said: "The million-dollar question everybody asks me is why I have turned my own husband in - what in heaven's name made me do it. The honest answer is not that I sought justice, but rather that I wanted revenge."
