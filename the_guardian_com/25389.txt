Gerry McCann is more convinced than ever that his daughter Madeleine is alive, following a meeting with US detectives. Almost exactly a year after she disappeared from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on 3 May, he firmly believes the youngster is 'out there' after assurances from officers involved in America's system for tracking down missing children. McCann and his wife, Kate, met officials from the US Amber Alert system, who reassured them that the majority of abducted children are found alive and that Madeleine's age -four - increased her chances of being found safe and well. During a recent trip to the US, the couple also met Ed Smart whose teenage daughter, Elizabeth, was missing for nine months before being found alive. Smart campaigned vigorously to keep his daughter's disappearance in the media until a passer-by recognised her with her abductor in the street.McCann said: 'We've spoken to a lot of people who have said that this is a country that has more than two stereotypical kidnappings per week, and of those only 40 to 50 per cent end up being found dead and, most importantly of all, the younger the child, the less likely the serious harm. 'And yes, there was a first time I've thought: "I really believe it".'
