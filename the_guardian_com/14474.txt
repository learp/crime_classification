David Cameron has refused to be driven into another policy U-turn on crime after rejecting calls from Ed Miliband for DNA to be routinely retained in rape cases.At prime minister's questions, Miliband said DNA should be retained from suspects who are arrested but not charged, as it might help secure convictions in other rape cases.The first clause of the protection of freedoms bill removes the right for the police to retain DNA of uncharged suspects except in a small number of exceptional cases.The bill is waiting its report stage in the Commons and Miliband is clearly trying to set up a challenge to Cameron's tougher law and order image. The prime minister is said to be especially sensitive to a recent rapid decline in support for him among women.Miliband taunted Cameron over his recent change of direction on polices including sentencing and the NHS.He asked: "Will he now change his mind on the proposal to prevent police holding the DNA of those arrested but not charged with rape?"He added that the charity Rape Crisis had warned that DNA evidence was "vital" in catching rapists."Around 5,000 people each year are arrested on suspicion of rape and not charged," he told Cameron ."In certain cases, these individuals have gone on to commit further offences and been convicted as a result of the DNA held on the national database."For the second week in succession at prime minister's questions, Cameron seemed unaware of the details of the issue on which he was being challenged, replying that ministers would "look carefully at the issues of DNA".The home secretary, Theresa May, leant across, apparently to tell Cameron that the police could apply to keep DNA, leading the prime minister to reject the Labour leader's appeal.Cameron said: "If he actually understood the policy, he would know that the police are allowed to apply to keep DNA on the computer."The Home Office said in cases where a person is arrested for a serious offence (including rape) but not charged, they will only have their details retained if it is sanctioned by a commissioner on biometric data. The exceptions were where the victim was under 18, a vulnerable adult, or in a close relationship with the person arrested. The police could also apply to keep DNA in other exceptional cases.Labour argued the government position was contradictory because people charged with a serious offence but not convicted will remain on the database. However those who are arrested, but not charged – as happens with over 60 % of rape cases – will not. As a result people found not guilty will still be on the government's database.Officials pointed out that the European court of human rights has ruled that a blanket policy of retaining all suspects' DNA would be illegal. That ruling means the UK has to adopt new rules, they said.
