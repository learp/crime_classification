The jury in the Mark Duggan inquest have been told they will hear claims that the gun found after he was shot dead by police may have been planted.The jury will hear a witness who saw the aftermath of the shooting of Duggan on 4 August 2011 in Tottenham, north London.The police shot dead Duggan claiming he was holding a gun when challenged by officers who believed he had a weapon and forced a cab he was travelling in to stop.Ashley Underwood QC, counsel to the inquest, told the jury that a local resident known only as Miss J will claim she saw suspicious activity by police after the shooting.Underwood said: "I need to explore with Miss J whether her evidence suggests that a police officer took the gun out from the minicab and planted it."All of that evidence will give you the opportunity to explore that possibility."Underwood said the witness had been close enough to see the colour of the gloves someone was wearing while they gave first aid as they tried in vain to save Duggan's life.Two police officers will tell the jury they saw Duggan holding a gun.A weapon, encased in a sock, was found three to six metres (10 to 20ft) from where he fell. Duggan's DNA was not on the weapon.The jury will on Thursday visit the scene where Duggan was shot by police in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, and the scene in Leyton, east London, where he is alleged to have collected the gun, which was in a shoe box.
