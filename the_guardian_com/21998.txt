A millionaire's daughter who stabbed a frail pensioner to death was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail after the judge labelled her a "remorseless and cold-blooded killer".Kemi Adeyoola was 17 when she murdered 85-year-old Anne Mendel, whose body was found by her husband in their home in Golders Green, north-west London, lying in a pool of her own blood. She had been stabbed 14 times.Adeyoola, now 18, hatched the murder plans while serving time in a juvenile detention centre for shoplifting. In an 18-page document found by officers, she sketched in detail how she would find a frail pensioner to rob and murder, listing equipment she would need, and what she would do with the money she stole. Throughout the trial the teenager insisted the notes were preparation for a crime novel she planned to write, a version of events the jury rejected.Judge Richard Hone described Adeyoola as intelligent and manipulative and said it was likely she would not be deemed safe to release at the end of her term, which he set at a minimum of 20 years."I regret to say I have formed the view that you are a remorseless and cold-blooded killer who is a serious and continuing danger to the public. I believe that your motive was to draw attention to yourself by the act of murder. I think you wanted to experience what it felt like to kill someone in cold blood, possibly so that you could write about it, but more probably so that you could boast about it and possibly even do it again."The judge rejected arguments from defence counsel that he take into account the teenager's fractured upbringing when sentencing her. Henry Blaxland QC said she was "emotionally damaged" and was "utterly alone in the world". Adeyoola's parents divorced when she was a child and for many years she had no contact with her father, a millionaire property manager.The court heard she had been moved around to several different areas and schools during her childhood. She had shoplifted from a young age and had worked as an escort.But the judge told Adeyoola her family background was no "explanation for the enormity of what you did."
