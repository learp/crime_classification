A controlled explosion was carried out at a house in Bristol in the early hours of this morning and a man arrested under the terrorism act, police said.About 30 people have been evacuated from neighbouring homes.A 19-year-old man who lived at the house is currently being questioned by anti-terrorist officers at an undisclosed police station in the Avon and Somerset area.Detectives were today refusing to say what prompted the arrest, what materials were destroyed or name the teenager at the heart of the incident.Avon and Somerset's assistant chief constable, Jackie Roberts, said: "During yesterday and overnight, Avon and Somerset constabulary have been coordinating a number of covert inquiries."As a result, a 19-year-old man was arrested yesterday afternoon under the Terrorism Act 2000."He has been taken to a police station within the force area and a warrant was executed to search his home in the Westbury-on-Trym area."A number of people were evacuated from neighbouring homes as a precaution, and just after 2am this the morning, the explosives ordnance disposal team conducted a controlled explosion at the location."Local resident Margaret Ball, 66, a retired banquet worker, said: "I just woke up to a dreadful bang last night. It was really out of the ordinary."Initially I thought it was kids who had had come down the lane and kicked off my waterpipe but then my son came rushing into the room and said 'mum, there are police everywhere'."Roberts said police were continuing to liaise with various "relevant agencies" to further the investigation.She added: "This is likely to be a prolonged, complex and sensitive inquiry which may take some time.""It was a controlled explosion and the materials will be sent off for analysis."We responded to intelligence given to us in the last 24 hours."The house, in Comb Paddock, a cul-de-sac, was likely to be cordoned off for the remainder of the day, she said.Roberts added: "We would like to reassure people that this arrest has been made to prevent harm."It is unlikely that those who have been evacuated will be able to return to their homes until much later today at the earliest." She would not say if any more arrests would be made in connection with the incident.The controlled explosion also involved officers from Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism unit.A letter sent to residents of Comb Paddock today from Avon and Somerset police's Inspector Mark Jackson, warned of a large presence of officers in the area and "some disruption", before going on to say that the19-year-old was arrested "in connection with a potentially serious criminal matter"Those evacuated before the blast were not told the reasons why they had to leave their home. They were put up in hotels overnight.Neighbours of the arrested man described being woken by the noise of the explosion.Sheila Cook said: "I went outside and found the whole police force there and they just told me to get back inside. "When I woke up this morning there was a letter telling me they had arrested someone and it was part of an ongoing investigation and that is all I know." Another resident, who asked not to be named, said she heard the blast in the middle of the night."I thought it was an explosion, someone's gas boiler blowing up. I guessed it was near, I thought a bungalow had gone up."
