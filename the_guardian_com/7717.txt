It was my son who rang to tell me April had gone missing – he'd seen the news on Facebook. We went straight up to Bryn-y-gog, where she was abducted, and there were 200 people there. Some had been knocking on doors looking for her. We all went into the countryside around Machynlleth looking for this white van. It surprises me now how methodical we were.When we came home in the morning there were lots of officers stopping traffic, and volunteers from all over the country coming in. Some brought crates of crisps and sandwiches. People in the community centre were cooking the volunteers roast dinners. I remember being very grateful for being sent dry socks, because we were out in terrible weather conditions.On Tuesday I put my collar back on. That night, I held a prayer vigil in the church and although there weren't many words exchanged the feeling of love and closeness between everybody was unbelievable.Nearly three months on, we are still focused on finding this little girl. Mark Bridger is going to court on 11 January. There are still more than 100 police here until Christmas and nobody will rest until she is found. I see April's mother on the street trying to do things normally – getting on for the sake of her other children. They will never understand what went on. Neither will we, but we are trying to stay strong.Donations to April's Fund can be made to MTC, Y Plas, Aberystwyth Road, Machynlleth, Powys SY20 8ER
