John Leslie, the former Blue Peter and This Morning presenter, was arrested last night over an allegation that he raped a woman nearly 13 years ago.Leslie, 43, who has previously been investigated and cleared over separate sex charges, was bailed until August while police inquiries continue.In 2002 Leslie was linked to a claim by TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson in her autobiography that she had been sexually assaulted, but he was never charged. Police went on to charge him with two indecent assaults, in May 1997, against another woman. But the charges were dropped in May 2003 and prosecutors said he should leave court "without a stain on his character".Last night a Met police spokesman said: "Officers are investigating an allegation of rape and indecent assault on a woman dating from November 1995. A man in his 40s attended a London police station by appointment and was arrested in connection with the inquiry. He was interviewed and bailed pending further inquiries to a date in late August."
