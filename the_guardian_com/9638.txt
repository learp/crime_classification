A British expatriate yesterday became the first formal suspect in the disappearance of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, with police admitting he was the main focus of their investigation.But detectives said they did not have enough evidence to charge Robert Murat under Portuguese law. The 33-year-old estate agent was released after questioning but he will not be allowed to leave the country and will have to report to police on a regular basis.Family and friends of Mr Murat immediately protested his innocence and his mother, Jenny, whose home is 150 metres from where Madeleine went missing, said her son was worried police had picked on him because they were desperate to find a British suspect.Mr Murat last night told Sky News he was being made a scapegoat and the investigation "had ruined his life".In an unusual move, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service also expressed concern about some reporting of the case.At a press conference yesterday, the lead investigating officer, Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa, gave few details about the inquiry but confirmed that the main line of investigation related to five properties searched on Monday, the most significant being Casa Liliana, the house Mr Murat shares with his mother.Mr Sousa seemed more hopeful that his team had promising leads, but admitted he still had no idea where Madeleine might be. Asked whether he was hopeful charges would be brought against the suspect, Mr Sousa said: "Let's wait and see. We are hopeful that this case will be over in the near future."Friends described Mr Murat, who is half-Portuguese, as someone whose over-enthusiasm could lead to him being misunderstood. He was first reported to police by British journalists, who became suspicious of the way he was hanging around the investigation.His German girlfriend, Michaela Walczuch, was interviewed on Monday in Portimao, near Praia da Luz, but is not considered a suspect.Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, will stay at the resort where Madeleine went missing 13 days ago, working with British lawyers who are coordinating a fund to help the investigation.
