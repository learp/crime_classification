The government has only itself to blame for the controversy over incitement to religious hatred (Blunkett attacked on new law, December 8). The use of the words "religious hatred" implies that criticising or mocking religion will become unlawful, so no one should be surprised that some religions think they will be able to prosecute anyone who insults their beliefs, while others reject the bill because they think that it will prevent legitimate debate or jokes about religion.If the bill had been drafted in terms of incitement of hatred of people on grounds of their religious or non-religious beliefs and included clear safeguards to protect free speech, and if the blasphemy law (which protects beliefs, not people) were abolished at the same time, I think even Rowan Atkinson might be content. The government does have a responsibility to protect people from incitement to hatred, but this bill, as drafted, will do more harm than good. Hanne StinsonBritish Humanist AssociationYour report about the proposals in the serious organised crime and police bill to create a new offence of incitement to religious hatred suggests that Liberal Democrats oppose the bill (Comedian stands up for right to joke about religion, December 7). This is not the case. While we are against the incitement clause in the bill, we support most of the rest of it. Indeed it is typical of the government to introduce a highly contentious piece of legislation within a much wider bill and rush it through parliament. The government's aim is to challenge those who defend freedom of expression to block the passage of the whole bill. It seems that this proposal is more of a clumsy and ill-judged attempt to gain favour with the Muslim community to compensate for a dismal and damaging foreign policy than a mature and deliberative attempt to find the correct balance between free speech and religious harmony.Dr Evan Harris MPLib Dem, Oxford West and Abingdon
