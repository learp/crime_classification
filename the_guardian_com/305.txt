The mother of a four-year-old girl who died after suffering "sustained, deliberate and brutal" abuse was today jailed for life for her murder.Leticia Wright took at least two days to die after receiving the sort of injuries usually suffered by car crash victims, Bradford crown court was told.Sharon Wright, 23, and her 22-year-old boyfriend, Peter Seaton, were jointly found guilty of her murder. Each was jailed for life and told they would serve at least 23 years.The court heard how Seaton had moved into Wright's home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, three months before Leticia's death.Prosecutors said the pair embarked on a sickening "joint enterprise" to assault her in the final two weeks of her life. She was killed despite a visit from social workers a month before she died.In her final weeks, neighbours said they had seen Leticia "standing vigil" at her bedroom window, and that she had waved at them.Two were so concerned that they contacted Kirklees council and, on October 13 last year, two social workers visited the house.Linda Blackie and Nicola Stephenson found nothing obviously amiss and, after checking that Leticia had been registered with a nursery, they closed her file.On November 18, paramedics found the girl lying bruised and naked on the living room floor at her home. She had cigarette burns and bite marks, and died in hospital in the early hours of the next morning from injuries inflicted on her stomach and head.Doctors said the back of her head was like a "boggy mess", and her scalp was infected.Forensic officers later found clumps of her hair in the wheelie bin outside the house and bloody "swipe marks" from her hair on the living room wall. In total, she had suffered more than 100 injuries.Wright had blamed Seaton for the injuries and broke down in court as she described how he had killed the girl after going into a rage because he had run out of skunk, a potent form of cannabis.Seaton smoked up to Â£140 worth of cannabis a week, the court was told.He admitted biting the girl, but denied he was a cannabis addict and that he had inflicted the fatal blows.Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, said a post-mortem showed that injuries to Leticia's abdomen were similar to the trauma suffered by people in road accidents or those who fall from great heights."It's not possible to say which of the two assaulted her bringing about her death, but it's proper inference that they were in it together, that they both embarked on a joint enterprise to assault Leticia," he said.Following the hearing, Leticia's natural father, Zaheer Hussain, said in a statement: "We haven't got over the shock of her loss and we don't think we ever will. She was a beautiful little girl, always happy and smiling, and she had everything to live for."Detective superintendent Paul Taylor, who led the police investigation, said: "[Leticia] has been completely betrayed by her own mother and her boyfriend - two people who should have been caring for her."He said Wright and Seaton were "very unpleasant people. When they got together they were a fatal cocktail. Those two people wanted to be together and Leticia was in the way".Paul Johnson, the head of safeguarding at Kirklees council and a member of the Kirklees Safeguarding Children Board, defended the local authority's handling of the case.He said a council review carried out by an "independent professional" concluded Leticia's death "could not have been foreseen", but conceded that "certain aspects could have been handled differently".
