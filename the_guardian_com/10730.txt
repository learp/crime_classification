Ministers have announced that the NHS is to take over the running of prison health services in England from next year.The responsibility for funding prison healthcare will from April 2003 be transferred from the Home Office to the Department of Health (DoH).Primary care trusts will then become responsible for commissioning and providing health services to local prisoners.The move will be supported by extra DoH investment in prison healthcare, rising to an extra Â£46m per year by 2005-06.This additional funding is expected to be targeted at improving prison mental health services and primary care, as well as combating infectious diseases such as hepatitis.The prisons minister, Hilary Benn, said improving prison healthcare to meet NHS standards would help reduce reoffending.He said: "Improving health services for prisoners is important for their rehabilitation and resettlement to reduce their chances of reoffending."We know that health problems such as mental illness can contribute to reoffending, so high quality, professional care, which continues on release, is vital."It has long been acknowledged that mental health and drug misuse are far more common among prisoners than in the general population."We need to do more to meet their needs by improving prison healthcare to meet NHS standards."The main health problems facing prisoners are mental illness, drug addiction and infectious diseases.Around 90% of all prisoners have a mental health disorder, substance misuse problem or both. Nearly a quarter of prisoners have injected drugs, with 20% of these infected with hepatitis B and 30% with hepatitis C.
