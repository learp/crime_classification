Killer Jeremy Bamber's latest legal action in his long-running battle to overturn his convictions for murdering five relatives 27 years ago has beenthrown out by high court judges.Bamber, 51, wanted to challenge a refusal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the independent body which investigates possible miscarriages of justice, to refer his case back to the court of appeal to be looked at again.Thursday's hearing followed the rejection by a single judge, who studied the case papers in private, of Bamber's application for permission to seek judicial review of the CCRC's decision.His renewed application was refused by Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen's Bench Division, and Mr Justice Globe.Thomas, announcing the decision of the court, said that having looked at the approach taken by the CCRC in the case he could not see any way in which a challenge could be made to the decision reached.Thomas said: "It seems to me that a challenge is impossible to mount."Bamber, who is serving a whole-life term for the 1985 killings, has always protested his innocence and claims his sister, Sheila Caffell, shot her family before turning the gun on herself in a remote Essex farmhouse.Announcing its decision in April, the CCRC said that, despite a lengthy and complex investigation, it "has not identified any evidence or legal argument that it considers capable of raising a real possibility that the court of appeal would quash the convictions".Bamber and two other murderers are involved in a European court battle against their "whole-life" prison terms that give prisoners no chance of release.Lawyers are urging judges in Strasbourg to rule that UK law allowing the most dangerous offenders to be kept behind bars until they die breaches their human rights.
