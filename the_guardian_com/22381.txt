Detectives investigating the murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler arrested a man yesterday in connection with a car they believe was used to abduct her.The 40-year-old from west London, taken into custody after voluntarily attending a police station and later released without charge, was being questioned over a red Daewoo Nexia. The car was captured on CCTV in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, close to where Milly, 13, vanished in March 2002 on her way home from school. Her body was found six months later in woods near Fleet, Hampshire.Levi Bellfield, a 39-year-old wheel-clamper and bouncer, was identified as the prime suspect in her murder after being convicted last year of killing two women and brutally attacking a third.Detectives discovered that Bellfield's former partner, Emma Mills, owned a red Daewoo Nexia which she reported stolen four days after Milly's disappearance.Mills, who gave evidence for the prosecution against Bellfield, rented a flat in Collingwood Place just yards from where Milly was last seen.Despite repeated requests for information, police have so far been unable to trace the vehicle.A spokeswoman for Surrey police said yesterday: "The 40-year-old man arrested by Surrey police this morning after voluntarily attending a police station has been released without charge."The man, from west London, was questioned about the potential disposal of a red Daewoo Nexia car, which police have appealed for information about as part of their investigation into the murder of Milly Dowler."The investigation into Milly's death remains an active inquiry."
