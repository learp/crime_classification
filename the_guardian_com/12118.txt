Gang members who terrorised a quiet market town, behaving like "feral animals", have been jailed in spite of claims that they had changed character since their final rampage.A judge handed down sentences totalling eight years to two teenagers and two older men who briefly made the Yorkshire town of Thirsk notorious for violence.A major tourist attraction as the fictional home of the vet James Herriot, the town was prowled in 2009 by the gang, usually drunk and singling out servicemen from nearby army and RAF garrisons.They used knives, machetes and vicious violence on victims who were also stamped on, bitten and punched.A 48-year-old victim was so traumatised by an attack, which knocked out some of his teeth after he complained about late-night party noise, that he hardly ventured out of his house and his business collapsed.Judge Peter Bowers told the four, who admitted affray and threatening behaviour at Teesside crown court: "You are a disgrace. You ran around Thirsk like a pack of feral animals."You were uncontrolled, drunk, loutish and prepared to take on any of the locals or soldiers who happened to be visiting Thirsk."Defence solicitors said the four, who were all teenagers at the time of the attacks, had since mended their ways.But the judge replied: "It is all too little, too late. The only way to send a clear message out to other louts prepared to behave in this way is to send you all away."Kenny-Lee Wilson, now 21, was jailed for three years; Daniel Dodsworth, 20, and Jamie Marsden, 19, for two years each; and Richard Clark, 17, for a year.Bowers lifted a court order which had previously banned the media from naming Clark because of his youth at the time of the violence."I take the view that this sort of violence should be reported and see no reason why a 17-year-old should not be named," he said.The court heard all four men had previous convictions for violence and public disorder.Thirsk's pretty cottages and cobbled square became well-known internationally in the 1970s through the Herriot stories.Their author, Alf White, had his real-life veterinary practice in nearby Kirkgate, and TV and film episodes featured many other parts of the town.
