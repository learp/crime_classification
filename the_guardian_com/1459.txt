Dr Alan Williams, the forensic pathologist whose failure to disclose microbiology tests showing Harry Clark had an infection could have played a key role in the conviction of Sally Clark, is being investigated by the General Medical Council.Martin Bell, Sally and Stephen Clark's former MP in Tatton, Cheshire, lodged complaints against Dr Williams and Prof Michael Green, another forensic pathologist on the case.Mr Bell said his complaints were initially thrown out by the GMC, then reinstated when he sent new evidence, including details of three more cases in which Dr Williams had been criticised or a jury directed to acquit following his evidence for the crown.The complaints have reached the GMC's preliminary proceedings committee . It decides whether cases should go to a full hearing by the professional conduct committee, which can strike a doctor off. The conduct committee adjourned its hearing pending the outcome of Mrs Clark's appeal.The other cases Mr Bell mentioned to the GMC include that of a mother charged with murdering her baby, which went to Chester crown court in 2000. The judge directed the jury to acquit after the crown presented its case, and criticised Dr Williams for changing his evidence.In another of the cases, the judge directed the jury to acquit a dentist and an anaesthetist charged with killing a child during dental treatment, following Dr Williams's cross-examination in which he conceded that the girl might have died from a congenital heart abnormality.The third case was an inquest at which Dr Williams gave evidence that a man had died from being given the wrong drugs, but a second pathologist found evidence of a coronary artery abnormality.Dr Williams is the holder of a distinction award for "outstanding contribution to the NHS". The award boosts his salary by an extra Â£27,000.Dr Williams is one of a small number of Home Office pathologists who combine forensic pathology with their NHS work as a hospital pathologist.He initially said Harry had died from being shaken, but changed his finding to smothering during the trial. Prof Green, who was professor of forensic pathology at Sheffield University before his retirement, and who was brought into the case by Dr Williams, also changed his opinion about the cause of death.Dr Williams had known about Harry's infection since February 1998 but did not tell lawyers in the case.The Medical Protection Society released a statement on behalf of Dr Williams saying he was unable to comment on the outcome of the case as legal proceedings were outstanding.
