Zoo owner Derek Curtis said today that he feared the worst for a baby penguin whose plight has hit the headlines around the world after being stolen from a zoo five days ago.Mr Curtis said he believed three-month-old Toga to be dead after a man called GMTV to say he had stolen it and dumped it in a plastic bag at Portsmouth dockyard.The 1ft-high penguin is believed to have been stolen from Amazon World in Sandown on the Isle of Wight, sometime during Saturday night.Zoo staff have warned that without the care of its parents the rare bird would die. They think the popularity of the hit documentary film March of the Penguins may have inspired the crime."I am very pessimistic, I think we have lost it, it has been too long. I think that the person who phoned GMTV was genuine because we got his phone number and I spoke to him," Mr Curtis said."He said he worked at the docks and dumped it on the side of the dock. The phone has now gone dead and he's not answering it."Mr Curtis said he understood Hampshire police and Ministry of Defence police were keeping an eye out for the penguin as they carried out their regular patrols of the dockyard."Unfortunately the police are not treating this like they would a missing human. As far as I am concerned it should be treated the same, but at the end of the day it is a bird. Having said that, the police have been co-operating, but they can't do everything because it is a bird," he said.A Hampshire police spokeswoman said the report of Toga being left at Portsmouth dockyard was just one of a number of leads."We are aware that GMTV has received an anonymous call stating the penguin had been seen at Portsmouth dockyard. "This is just one of a number of reported sightings," she said.A spokesman for the Portsmouth Continental Ferryport said: "We have been in contact with the dockyard and the penguin has not been seen by anyone. Police at the dockyard have been informed and will be keeping a look out. It is pretty bad if the penguin has been left in a plastic bag."Staff at the Royal Navy base at Portsmouth and Portsmouth Historic Dockyard said they had no reports of a sighting of the penguin.A reward of more than Â£3,000 has been offered from the zoo and other contributors for Toga's safe return.
