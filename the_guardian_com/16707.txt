Britain has the highest rate of burglary in the European Union and is also nearly top of the league for assaults and hate crime, according to a recent survey.The EU crime and safety survey names the UK as a "high crime country" and says the risk of becoming a victim of the 10 most common crimes is, with the exception of Ireland, the highest across the European Union.London also emerges as the "crime capital of Europe" with the likelihood of becoming a victim - mostly of a range of petty crimes - said to be higher than all other EU capitals and even higher than cities such as Istanbul and New York.The findings will dismay Home Office ministers who boast that the 35% fall in crime in Britain since 1995 has brought the risk of becoming a victim down to its lowest level for 40 years.The survey acknowledges that crime has fallen in the UK since it peaked in 1995, but says it has not dropped as fast as crime rates across the rest of the EU.The UK is named alongside Ireland, Estonia, the Netherlands and Denmark as the crime hotspots of Europe with crime victim rates that are at least 30% higher than the EU average.It does, however, contain some positive news for Britain, saying that there is an extremely low chance compared with many other EU countries of becoming a victim of attempted bribery, while consumer fraud is not a cause for concern. It adds that despite the poor crime record British residents are reasonably happy with the performance of the police and are not overly concerned about burglary or safety on the streets.The survey, carried out by Gallup Europe for the UN crime prevention agency and funded by the European Commission, says that no single factor can explain the drop in crime across Europe over the past 10 years but that a fall in the proportion of young males and improved security measures such as burglar and car alarms are probably more influential than tough sentencing policies or rising prison populations.Its says that "sentencing policies in Europe as a whole are considerably less punitive than in the US and yet crime is falling just as steeply in Europe as it is in the US". The authors add that Britain and Ireland stand almost alone in Europe in jailing persistent burglars rather than using community service orders to punish them.The findings of the survey, organised by the UN's crime justice research institute and based on polling representative samples in 18 EU countries about their experience of crime, show the UK to be one of the most protected countries in Europe but with a crime rate way above the average.They show Britain: · has the highest level of assaults involving threats but not violence in the EU, with 5% of the public saying they have been a victim of assault· is the most burgled country in the EU, with 3% saying their homes have been broken into· has a high level of hate crime - 3% - and above-average rate of hate crimes that occur within the immigrant population· has a high risk of theft from cars - 5% compared with EU average of 3.5%· has an above-average level of pickpocketing and personal theft - one of only three countries in the EU, with Ireland and Estonia, to be above the average level.The comparison of crime rates in individual capitals and major cities shows the 32% of the residents of London have been a victim of 10 categories of offences ranging from assault to sexual harassment to burglary. The comparable figures were 18% for Istanbul and 23% for New York.But the Home Office minister Tony McNulty disputed the survey's findings, saying there were concerns about its quality. He said the report failed to recognise that burglary had fallen by 55% since 1997 in England and Wales.The survey prompted the Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, to claim that Britain was now the "sick man of Europe" when it came to crime: "The government should ask itself why the prisons are at bursting point and yet the level of several crimes are still higher than elsewhere in the EU. The present strategy must be rethought urgently."In numbers30% The percentage above the EU average of crime victim levels in Britain3% The percentage of British respondents who say their homes have been burgled5% The risk of car crimes in the UK, well above the EU average of 3.5%
