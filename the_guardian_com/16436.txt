Seventy-two-year-old Allan Savage was jailed for life yesterday for the murder in September 1976 of newsagent Geoffrey Small.The Old Bailey heard that Savage had confessed to police last year after seeing an emotional appeal from Small's daughter, Cathy, on BBC1's Crimewatch show. Savage, of Hastings, East Sussex, told police he had been hired by a son of a woman with whom Small had been having an affair. Jailing the frail Savage, Judge Martin Stephens told him: "It took 26 years for you to face up to what you had done. This was a cold-blooded, brutal murder carried out for gain." The court heard that Savage, a small-time crook, had been promised £2,000 but only received £700. Small, a 46-year-old married man with two children, was found shot at his newsagent in Sutton, Surrey. Jane Carpenter, defending, said Savage had "deep regret over the hurt he has caused the Small family". "Since 1976, he always believed the day would come when he would have to pay for what he did," she said, adding that since that day he has regretted his action. "Watching Crimewatch, he felt the time had come to put the record straight." Crispin Aylett, prosecuting, said Savage had entered the shop before it opened. He waited for Small to arrive and fired six shots at him. Four hit him - two in the head and two in the chest. He stole takings of £150 and Small's wallet to make the killing look like a robbery but police soon discounted such a theory. Small had been having an affair with Jane Ward, a married woman with two sons. All were interviewed, but no link to the killing could be proved. Years later police were told Savage had confessed to the murder and reopened the file. After arranging to interview him, they placed Cathy Small on Crimewatch to talk about the pain caused to her family. Robert Ward, 47, is to be tried at the Old Bailey for murder in September. He has denied the offence.
