Police investigating the murder of Joanna Yeates have advised local women not to walk home alone after dark and warned householders to make sure their homes were secure.Officers acknowledged there were "concerns for safety" among Bristol residents while the killer remains at large but emphasised they had received no "specific intelligence" to suggest there was any increased danger.Avon and Somerset police denied the inquiry was back to square one after they released Yeates's landlord, Chris Jefferies, on bail two days after he was arrested on suspicion of murder.Officers insisted progress was being made. They had received thousands of calls and messages from people with possible leads, and a source said they were waiting for the completion of forensic tests that could prove crucial.Speaking outside Yeates's flat in Clifton, Bristol, Chief Superintendent Jon Stratford said extra police patrols were taking place."I can understand why the public have concerns for their safety. Whoever killed Jo remains at large," he said. "However I want to reassure the public there remains no specific intelligence or information to suggest there is an increased threat to safety."Naturally we ask the public to continue to take the usual safety precautions. Lone women should avoid walking home alone after dark and householders should keep their premises secure and take care when answering the door to strangers."Stratford added: "The investigation into Jo's murder continues with well over 70 police officers and staff dedicated to solving this crime. We have been overwhelmed by the level of response from members of the public and continue to ask anyone who thinks they may have any information to contact us."Yeates's body was found on Christmas morning, clothed and covered in snow, on a roadside verge at Failand, north Somerset, three miles from the flat she shared with her boyfriend, Greg Reardon. She had been strangled.On Thursday, Jefferies, 65, who lives in the same building as Yeates on Canynge Road, was arrested on suspicion of murdering the 25-year-old landscape architect. He was held until Saturday when he was freed on police bail.Police insist they are keeping an open mind over whether or not Yeates knew her murderer, but continue to suggest they do not believe a random stranger was responsible – which is why they are not issuing stronger safety warnings.They confirmed that no links had been found between Yeates's death and other killings, including the unsolved murder of 25-year-old Melanie Hall, who went missing from a nightclub in Bath in 1996, or that of 20-year-old Glenis Carruthers, who was strangled to death in 1974 in Clifton, a few minutes' walk from Canynge Road.The detective leading the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones, is expected to appear at a press conference tomorrow for the first time since he declared that the case had turned into a murder hunt last Tuesday.He has said he is particularly keen to hear from anyone who used Longwood Lane, where Yeates's body was found, between Friday 17 December, when she was last seen, and Christmas morning.Police and Yeates's boyfriend have expressed concern at some of the reporting of the case, particularly of the way Jefferies has been portrayed in mainstream media and on social networking websites.Reardon said the "finger-pointing and character assassination" had been "shameful" and called for greater sensitivity. Last week the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, warned the media to be mindful of contempt of court laws.Jefferies has not appeared back at his flat since he was released on police bail. It is believed he is staying with friends, possibly away from Bristol.It is understood that a lawyer for Jefferies has written to at least one newspaper criticising its reporting of the case.Over the weekend Reardon and Yeates's family released emotional tributes to her.Reardon said he would always love her and described as "a beautiful woman, beautiful in mind, body and soul".Her family said: "We will always miss the presence which came with her; hearing her voice, her lightness, and standing back with pride, watching her grow through life."Anyone who can help the investigation can call the Operation Braid incident room on 0845 456 7000 or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.A £10,000 reward is being offered to anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the killer.
