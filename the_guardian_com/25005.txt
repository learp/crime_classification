Police officers in London have been told they can drop the crown and cross from their official uniform badge, if it offends them on religious grounds.The Metropolitan police confirmed yesterday it has agreed to the concession as part of its attempt to open the force to recruits from minority ethnic backgrounds. The decision, taken earlier this year, followed the resignation of a Muslim traffic warden, employed by the Met, who said he found it impossible to wear a Christian cross on his uniform. "We recognise that the future of the Met depends on our ability to attract and retain the most talented people and cater for their individual needs and requirements," said a Scotland Yard spokesman. "The Met cherishes its long association with the crown, and all employees will of a matter of course be issued with the traditional insignia. However, if employees specifically state that they cannot wear that insignia for what appears to be supportable reasons, then they will be issued with other insignia not incorporating the crown." At present there are 1,300 black or Asian officers in the force, or 4.9% of the total. It is not yet known what form the altered badge will take.
