The body of a British yachtsman murdered by pirates off Thailand last week was found yesterday, the Foreign Office in London confirmed last night.Three Burmese migrant workers have been accused of slitting Malcolm Robertson's throat and throwing his body overboard when they attacked the yacht he was sailing with his wife Linda.Reports in Thailand said his body was recovered by fishermen about 11 miles north of Lipeh island, part of Thailand's Satun province. The discovery follows several false reports of the body being found.A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: "A body recovered by the Thai authorities has been identified as Mr Robertson. Our thoughts are with Mrs Robertson and her family at this difficult time. The embassy team with them is providing consular support."The migrant workers who were arrested on a raft about half a mile from the couple's 44ft yacht, Mr Bean, were charged with kidnap, assault and theft, but the Thai authorities had said they could not bring a murder charge until Mr Robertson's body was found.Mr Robertson, 64, owned a chain of coffee shops in and around his home town of Hastings, East Sussex. He and his wife of 25 years each had two children from previous relationships who have travelled to Thailand to support their mother, 57. She escaped the ordeal with minor injuries.Her brother, John Clee, 63, from Battle, East Sussex, said last night that the family felt a sense of relief after fearing that Robertson's body would never be found. "There is a feeling of relief. I had a text message from Linda saying how he was identified, and how she was now feeling totally drained. This sorts a lot of things out. We know that charges of murder can now be laid against those responsible. My sister can also bring home her husband and hopefully bring some closure to this."A Thai police captain claimed this week that the three men who had been arrested had confessed to the killing.
