The acclaimed artist Graham Ovenden, who specialises in images of children, is a paedophile who sexually abused young girls, a jury has been told.When he was arrested, Ovenden, whose work has been hung by the Tate, told police he was a "distinguished" artist who had created some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 years.But opening the case against him at Truro crown court, Ramsay Quaife, prosecuting, said Ovenden had abused four of the girls – now adults – who had posed for him.The prosecution claims the girls were aged between six and 14 when they were abused at Ovenden's former and current homes in London and Cornwall.Quaife told the court: "What we say is that Mr Ovenden is a paedophile, a sexual abuser of children. We say the target of his abuse was young girls."All four of the claimants are now adult women. Their allegations go back some years."Ovenden, 70, denies charges of indecency with a child and indecent assault.The alleged victims made formal complaints to police in the late 2000s and Ovenden was arrested in 2008.Quaife said: "During the course of interviews with police, Mr Ovenden was to describe himself as an artist, a distinguished artist."He told police he still has a very major reputation as probably having entered some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 years."Asked about the alleged abuse of one of the girls, Ovenden admitted he took photographs of the girl and a few of them were "nudies", the court was told. But he denied that the images he took were of a sexual nature.The hearing continues.
