Staff at Leeds magistrates court are facing disciplinary action for serious errors which resulted in hundreds of offenders escaping prosecution, the Ministry of Justice said today. In November last year, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, announced an urgent inquiry at the court after it emerged arrest warrants for defendants who failed to appear in court had been withdrawn.A statement released by the ministry today said the inquiry painted a "lamentable picture of the historic failure" at the court."As a result of these investigations, disciplinary action has been initiated against members of staff at Leeds magistrates court who are implicated in these matters and in respect of those covered by a separate judicial report to the Lord Chief Justice," the statement said."The Inspectorates' report paints a lamentable picture of the historic failure at Leeds magistrates court to properly record the results of court adjudication dating back to 1980, with the vast majority occurring between 2001 and 2004."According to the statement, inspectors found "considerable irregularities" in the process for the withdrawal of warrants. The blunders meant warrants were withdrawn in relation to 555 defendants, representing 1,709 offences. As a result, many cases were written off.The results of many cases were recorded improperly. Some of these were for low-level matters such as minor driving offences, but an undetermined number were for offences that should have been added to the police national computer, such as serious sexual assaults. The report revealed at least one occasion when legal advisers guessed the result of a case when recording it.The court blunders came to light after a national review of "the effectiveness of processes" for the 2.2m cases dealt with in UK magistrates courts each year. Researchers identified further problems with arrest warrants agreed by Leeds magistrates court dating from 2003.Today, the ministry said the court had improved controls and all court adjudications were now included on the court register.The statement said there was no evidence of warrants being withdrawn at the court since 2004, and that the results of 62 of the most serious offences had already been found and verified.
