The sons of a man who faked his own death in a canoe accident faced their mother in court today as they described how she had "betrayed" them.Mark Darwin, 32, said his "world was crushed" when he was told his father, John Darwin, was missing, presumed dead, off the Hartlepool coast in 2002.He told the Teesside crown court jury of his anger toward his mother, Anne, when he saw a photograph on the internet of his smiling parents together in Panama four years later."I couldn't believe the fact she knew he was alive all this time and I had been lied to for God knows how long," he said.His brother, Anthony, 29, told the court when he saw the photo he felt "betrayed".Anne Darwin, 56, denies six counts of fraud and nine counts of money laundering. The prosecution alleges she played a "determined and resolute" part in the £250,000 fraud, to which her husband has already pleaded guilty.Anne, in the dock, wiped her eyes with a tissue and blew her nose as Mark gave evidence against her. The sons, both smartly dressed, did not look at her.Mark said his mother hugged him in the drawing room of her seafront home after their father vanished."She flung her arms around me, she said 'He's gone I think. I have lost him'. In the weeks that followed, his mother was "distraught" and could not eat, sleep or drink."She wandered around the house in a daze like the rest of us," Mark said.He said his mother sold off the couple's property portfolio in the following years, and put the titles of the family home and the bedsits next door in his name for "inheritance tax" reasons, but when she moved to Panama – a decision which surprised him - she took the £455,000 proceeds.The jury was told Anthony was going to propose to his fiancée, Louise, during a holiday to Canada when his father disappeared.He cut the trip short and visited his mother at their home in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, to find her "crying and shaking".When his father reappeared at a London police station last year, Anthony told the court he felt "disbelief and anger" because he originally thought it was someone pretending to be his dad.When he saw his father in the police station he felt "surprised, amazed, still almost disbelieving".The prosecution has already alleged in court that Anne Darwin "lied at length" about her role in the fraud.Anthony said he initially thought the photo of his parents together in Panama had been doctored. It was only the next day when he read a newspaper article with his mother's admission that the image was real that he finally believed it.Asked how he felt when he realised, Anthony scratched his head and replied: "Upset, betrayed, I don't know."Mark was at a wedding in Balham, south London, when he was telephoned by the police to say his father had walked into a police station.He told the jury he had no idea his father was still alive. He said he telephoned his mother in Panama, who "sounded really shocked that he had turned up after all these years".Both sons agreed their family life and childhoods were normal and happy. Their father was fond of moneymaking schemes, the court heard.They included making garden gnomes, making computer games, breeding snails and trading stocks and shares.Earlier, the court heard that even after being presented with overwhelming evidence to the contrary by detectives, Anne, 56, stuck resolutely to her story that she was a bereaved widow.Andrew Robertson QC, prosecuting, said that when Mr Darwin handed himself in last December, claiming to be suffering from amnesia, Mrs Darwin was living in Panama with assets of £500,000.The prosecution claims that after the photo of the couple in Panana emerged, Anne insisted her husband had been missing for 11 months before reappearing on her doorstep."She insisted that she had genuinely believed that he had drowned and had continued to believe he was dead when she began making claims on the insurance companies," Robertson said.But that too was a lie, he added. Only after police presented to her evidence that her husband had been living in a property next to their home in Seaton Carew, in the name of John Jones, did she change her story."Members of the jury, it is the crown's submission that, far from dealing here with a 'shrinking violet', we have here a determined, resolute woman who was able to lie and deceive at length - literally at length," Robertson added.Anne has put forward an initial defence of "marital coercion", claiming her husband forced her to go along with his plan.The court heard yesterday that John disappeared six days after being refused a £20,000 loan and was facing bankruptcy.Anne told their sons: "I think I've lost him. I think he's gone."Today, the prosecutor said: "It is the crown's submission that, when you have considered all the evidence, this woman cannot be said 'to have been forced to commit these offences in the presence of her husband'."She was able to act alone so effectively and did so because she was motivated by greed and eager for the fruits of this fraud to discharge the debt and enjoy an idyllic lifestyle."John has already admitted the fraud charges and agreed that the money laundering was part and parcel of the same fraud, Robertson told the jury.The case continues.
