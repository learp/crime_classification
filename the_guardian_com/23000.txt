A review has been commissioned to see what lessons can be learned after the fatal school stabbing of 16-year-old Bailey Gwynne, using a knife that had been bought on Amazon for £40.Aberdeen city council, NHS Grampian and Police Scotland said they would seek an independent chair to lead the exercise, a day after a trial concluded that Bailey’s 16-year-old killer was guilty of culpable homicide.Bailey was attacked at Cults Academy, one of Scotland’s highest performing state schools, on 28 October 2015. He died of his injuries at Aberdeen Royal infirmary shortly after the fight in a school corridor.During the five-day trial it emerged that the killer had been carrying to school on a regular basis a folding knife with an 8cm blade that he had bought on online.Cults’ headteacher, Anna Muirhead, also confirmed she had previously cautioned the defendant about the dangers of carrying a knife when he had been a much younger pupil, although the circumstances prompting this warning were not revealed in court.BBC Scotland has revealed that serious concerns were raised after the incident, which occurred in 2007 when the killer was seven, and resulted in the victim being treated for concussion.Bailey’s killer never denied stabbing the teenager but insisted that he “didn’t mean it”.The defence counsel, Ian Duguid QC, told the jury at Aberdeen high court in his concluding remarks: “If he was an aggressive and violent individual then the prosecution would have said so.”The parents of the child injured in 2007 contacted the police and the school involved but became concerned about what they saw as a lack of effective response.They spoke to the Aberdeen city councillor Marie Boulton, who pressed senior staff to carry out a full investigation and told the Guardian that she welcomed the independent inquiry. A council spokesperson said: “The review will be chaired by an independent expert who will also help shape the reporting timescale and terms of reference.”
