Chris Lewis, nicknamed Carl, may not have been as quick as his sprinter namesake, but his career once seemed destined for meteoric success. As many other promising England cricket all-rounders have found, however, being the "next Ian Botham" was as bad for his long-term prospects as being heralded the next leader of the Conservative party used to be.His international Test and one-day cricket averages never reflected the bright predictions made about him: he made one century as a batsman – in a losing cause in India – and had three five-wicket hauls as a bowler.As he rarely delivered on his potential – the 1992 World Cup being an exception – he became famous for other reasons: his Calvin Klein underpants; his late arrival for an England match pleading a puncture, which led to him being dropped for the following winter tour; and, most notoriously , the "prat without a hat" incident in the Caribbean when he had his head shaved by team-mate Devon Malcolm, failed to wear a hat and caught sunstroke, missing a warm-up game.He isolated himself from his peers within the game, first saying in an interview that he did not drink with county colleagues, and then towards the end of his professional career, offering the names of three England players allegedly involved in match-rigging.Lewis was a player about whom descriptions such as promising and multi-talented soon turned to mercurial and enigmatic, and long before the end of his international career, fragile and lacking in confidence. He was dogged by injury and had a condition known as Raynaud's phenomenon that affected his circulation.After six years as a Test player, an eight-year span in one-day internationals, and first-class appearances for three counties – Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Surrey – between 1987 and 2000, the sporting verdict would be that he never really did himself full justice.Quite another form of justice has ensured that his reputation is sunk for ever.
