He was taken back to Cheshire for questioning about the death of his wife, which came six months after the couple were married in Vicky Roberts' native town of Warrington.The alarm was raised when her parents failed to hear from her for several days and reported her missing to police. Her body was discovered four days ago. A postmortem revealed she had been strangled.Detectives earlier appealed for her husband to get in touch with them, and issued a description of him that drew attention to his distinctive spiky black hair and black eyebrows.

The latter featured in a selection on the couple's Facebook pages.Michael Roberts worked as a manager at a local branch of the Boots chemists chain and is understood to have moved recently to a different store. Friends posted messages on Facebook when news of the death broke, appealing to him to get in touch to avoid making the situation worse. He was wearing business clothes, including grey pinstripe trousers and black patent leather shoes when neighbours last saw him.A young couple on Swan's Reach, who did not want to be named, said he had called on them shortly before the alarm was raised, and had spent about half an hour in their flat.Vicky Roberts's body was found on Thursday night when police broke into the garage below the couple's third-floor flat.A spokeswoman for Cheshire police said: "Following inquiries, a 26-year-old man has been arrested in Wrexham."Detective Inspector Andrew Smith, leading the investigation, said that after the postmortem the hunt had become a murder inquiry.
