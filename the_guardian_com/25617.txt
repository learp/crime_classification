A Chinese gangmaster who left his cockle pickers to drown in rising tides at Morecambe Bay was today sentenced to 14 years in prison.Lin Liang Ren, 29, was last week convicted of the manslaughter of 21 workers who died in the Lancashire bay on February 5 2004.Twenty-three people - all illegal immigrants from China - drowned in the tragedy, but two of the bodies have never been found.Lin had been desperate to collect two lorryloads of cockles, despite having only half his workforce available. He failed to bring the cocklers to the shore before the tide swept in.He was also convicted of facilitating illegal immigration and perverting the course of justice.Passing sentence at Preston crown court today, Mr Justice Richard Henriques said Lin had "cynically and callously" exploited his countrymen and women and displayed total indifference to the fate of the victims.The judge described how Lin failed to alert the authorities for 50 minutes after becoming aware of the impending catastrophe. "Had you even then decided to evacuate the beach, there might have been no loss of life," he said.Mr Justice Henriques sentenced Lin, of Liverpool, to 12 years for the manslaughter charges and six years for the facilitation charges, which he ordered should run concurrently.He jailed him for a further two years for the charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, bringing the total sentence to 14 years, and recommended that Lin be deported to China on his release from jail.Lin's girlfriend, 21-year-old Zhao Xiao Qing, from Liverpool, was sentenced to two years and nine months for one count of facilitation - helping people breach immigration law - and three counts of perverting the course of justice.Mr Justice Henriques jailed Lin's cousin Lin Mu Yong, 31, also from Liverpool, for four years for facilitation and nine months for 10 unrelated counterfeiting offences.The cockle pickers, who were aged between 18 and 45, were using false cockling permits forged by Lin and his girlfriend when they became trapped by rising waters.Only one member of the team survived. Some made harrowing mobile phone calls to their relatives back home in China as the water rose higher in the minutes before their deaths.One victim, Guo Bin Long, told his wife: "Tell the family to pray for me. It's too close. I am dying."After the cocklers drowned, Lin tried to intimidate other workers to lie about the circumstances of their employment. He also lied to police, denying he was in charge of the cockle-picking team and telling detectives the bosses had died during the tragedy.He was behind a major operation that brought Chinese immigrants illegally to the UK for his own financial gain.Father and son businessmen David Anthony Eden Snr, 63, and David Anthony Eden Jnr, 35, who ran the Liverpool Bay Fishing Company, were cleared of breaching immigration law by employing illegal immigrants in connection with the tragedy.They had been accused of buying cockles harvested by the workers.
