Gary McKinnon's case against extradition has focused on fears that the 43-year-old hacker, who has Asperger's syndrome, could be incarcerated in a US "supermax" prison for up to 60 years.His barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, said McKinnon could suffer a psychotic breakdown or become suicidal if he faced trial or imprisonment in the United States.McKinnon, in an interview on Radio 5 Live, said he did not believe he would get a fair trial if he was extradited on charges of hacking into 97 computers, including those of Nasa and the Pentagon, and causing damage costing $700,000 (Â£430,000).McKinnon said: "There is no way I would get a jury of my peers in America. I would be tried in Virginia and lots of people in Virginia work for defence contractors. I'm accused of damaging defence computers."He would be likely to be taken away in chains on arrival in the US and held in prison awaiting trial.In an affidavit to the high court, Joel Sickler, head of justice at the Justice Advocacy Group in Virginia, said the US bureau of prisons had a "well-known and terrible track record of delivering on any type of healthcare required by an inmate, especially those with some form of mental impairment".Although the US department of justice has assured the Home Office McKinnon would be properly treated, conditions in supermax prisons are notoriously severe. They provide the highest level of security and are reserved for murderers, gang-related prisoners and those perceived to represent a threat to national security.In maximum security all prisoners have individual cells with sliding doors controlled from a central control room, with prisoners being allowed out of their cells for one hour a day, and food being provided through ports in the doors. When out of their cells, prisoners remain in the cell block. Restraints and escorts by correctional officers are used for movements outside the cell block.
