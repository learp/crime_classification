A review has been ordered into the care provided to a van driver with mental health problems who has been detained indefinitely at a secure hospital after killing a woman and injuring 17 others during a hit-and-run rampage.Matthew Tvrdon, who has paranoid schizophrenia, was told by a judge on Thursday that he should expect to spend many years in Ashworth secure psychiatric hospital for using his van as a "weapon" against families walking home from school in Cardiff.Mr Justice Wyn Griffiths said Trvdon's mental health declined after he phased out medication that had controlled his condition but he did not blame him for cutting out the drugs as he had been advised to do so.The Welsh government has asked the watchdog, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, to carry out a review of Tvrdon's treatment. The Cardiff and Vale University Health Board is also investigating the care he received.Mr Justice Wyn Griffiths told Tvrdon, who followed proceedings via video-link from Ashworth: "Eighteen people were directly affected by your actions - but they have had a much wider impact upon many more. You caused incalculable harm."Several relatives of victims reacted angrily as sentence was passed. "Is that all he's having?" one man shouted as he left Cardiff crown court in anger.Tvrdon, a 32-year-old tax office worker, had admitted the manslaughter of Karina Menzies, a mother-of-three, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, seven attempted murders and a string of other offences.During what was described in court as a 30-minute "journey of mayhem" he ploughed into groups of pedestrians in the Ely and Leckwith areas of the Welsh capital.Though his victims were strangers, Tvrdon later claimed he believed they had been "gas-lighting" him â€” trying to make him think he was going insane.It emerged that Tvrdon had a long history of mental illness and numerous contacts with mental health professionals. In 2003 Tvrdon had a severe psychotic illness and was admitted to a mental health hospital after jumping out of a window." In 2007 he was apprehended carrying an airgun and was sectioned under the mental health act.It was found he was suffering from auditory hallucinations and believed people were conspiring against him. But he was able to mask the symptoms and convinced a tribunal to release him.In 2011 he was judged not to be a danger and was discharged from a psychiatric hospital. He was also advised to gradually reduce his medication.The judge told Tvrdon: "As I understand it throughout the period 2003 to 2011 you were treated with appropriate medication for such an illness."He said that in the year before the events of last October, Tvrdon was advised as an outpatient to phase out his medication over the course of a year.The judge added: "There can be no doubt that the absence of medication during the period leading to October 2012 had a significant effect upon your health but I do not consider it appropriate to attach any blameworthiness to you for that state of affairs."
