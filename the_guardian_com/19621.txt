Members of ethnic minorities working as civilian support staff for Scotland Yard are far more likely to face disciplinary proceedings than their white counterparts, according to internal reports seen by the Guardian.They are also more likely to be sacked at the end of the process, leading senior Yard staff to warn that the disciplinary policy may be having an "adverse effect" on minority groups. The disclosure comes a month after another Scotland Yard report found that black people are far more likely than white people to face criminal charges rather than be cautioned when caught carrying cannabis in London.At the time the Yard refused to say whether it accepted that racism may be to blame, provoking black police officers to complain that there could be no other explanation.The latest two reports are based on a study of disciplinary proceedings brought against civilian staff, including traffic wardens and community support officers, working for the Metropolitan Police since April 2000, and include a detailed analysis of those cases brought during a seven-month period last year. No nationwide figures are thought to be available.They show that 38% of those disciplined during those months were members of ethnic minorities, while less than 24% of civilians working for the Yard were drawn from those minorities.When the authors examined just one group of civilian workers - police community support officers (PCSOs) - they found that 62% of those disciplined were members of ethnic minorities, while members of such minorities represented less than 37% of the total community support officers in the capital.The authors also noted: "From data collected since April 1 2000 there is an indication that a disproportionate number of black and Asian members of staff are subjected to stage four [dismissal]."While the authors conclude that further research is needed to explain the findings, they speculate that it could be the result of failures of training, either of staff or their managers, or a misunderstanding by managers of the Yard's disciplinary policy.They also suggest that some managers may be more likely to "play it by the book" when dealing with staff from ethnic minorities, rather than take informal action, because they fear being eventually accused of discrimination. "Is there over-cautiousness of line managers, using formal procedures for black and minority ethnic staff to ensure there is no subsequent backlash for failure to follow correct procedures in a race discrimination charge?" they write.The reports say, however, that examination of individual cases has not uncovered any "abuse of process", and add: "There is no evidence to suggest that the procedures are discriminatory."A Metropolitan Police spokesman said changes in the training of community support officers had largely overcome disciplinary problems. "PCSOs were introduced into the Metropolitan Police Service in 2002 and given the large scale of the programme - 500 were introduced in the first year - there were inevitably some initial teething problems," he said."We have revised the police staff discipline process and have systems in place to track progress and facilitate early resolution."But the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents many of the Yard's civilian staff and community support officers, said the force appeared to have learned little from a report two years ago by Lord Morris, the former union leader, that warned it was paying lip service to diversity and that ethnic minority officers still faced discrimination."Diversity is about more than ticking boxes, it is something that needs to be embedded within the culture of an organisation," a spokesman for the union said.He added that the PCS hopes to meet senior managers at Scotland Yard to see how the force can start to address the problems highlighted by the reports.The same analysis shows that female civilian staff at Scotland Yard are less likely to be disciplined than their male counterparts. Some 43% of disciplinary proceedings brought last year involved women, who make up 55% of the civilian workforce.
