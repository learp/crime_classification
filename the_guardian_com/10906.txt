Residents of Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Birmingham and Swansea who are charged with a criminal offence will be able to choose to be defended by a new US-style public defender from next May. The Lord Chancellor's Department will be piloting over four years the controversial new system, initially in four areas, with another two to follow. For the first time in England and Wales, cases will be prosecuted and defended by state lawyers. A similar scheme in Scotland is halfway through a five year pilot. In England and Wales, solicitors on the staff of the new public defender service will act as duty lawyers advising suspects in police stations, representing them in magistrates court and organising their defence in the crown court. The public defenders will have to compete for clients with the private practice law firms. The parent body, the legal services commission, is considering local advertising to boost the public defenders' profile and attract clients. The idea of state employed defence lawyers was strenuously opposed by the bar, which argued that a state defence service would be starved of funds, as the crown prosecution service was at its start, and unable to attract the best lawyers. Critics argue that having state lawyers on both sides could lead to cosy carve-ups between prosecution and defence. They cite public defender systems in some parts of the US which are underfunded, swamped with cases and seen as delivering a third-rate service. But in other parts of the US and in Canada, public defender services work well. Solicitors are also suspicious of the service, fearing it will take away their clients and seduce their staff by paying higher salaries. Lord Bach, the minister responsible for criminal justice, and Steve Orchard, the chief executive of the legal services commission, promised yesterday that public defenders would not suffer the same work overloads and shortage of resources which have plagued the crown prosecution service.
