New government tables today named the best and worst police forces in England and Wales.The Home Office's police performance assessments compare forces but do not provide an overall league table.West Mercia, West Midlands, Hampshire and Surrey were the forces that performed best in 2004-05, according to the tables, while Humberside, Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire, the Metropolitan police and Cambridgeshire were at the bottom of the tables. The documents include assessments by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), which used to be published separately.All 43 police forces in England and Wales were assessed in seven categories: reducing crime, investigating crime, promoting safety, providing assistance, citizen focus (which includes community confidence in the police), resource use and local policing.Overall, 9% of results were classed as poor, 40% as fair, 44% as good and 7% as excellent.The figures also indicated that in 56% of cases, forces were improving their performance and in 39% their performance was stable, but in 5% performance had deteriorated.Six forces - Dyfed Powys, Gwent, Kent, Northamptonshire, Northumbria and the West Midlands - had deteriorated in the investigating crime category.The Home Office minister Hazel Blears said that overall, performance was "very encouraging"."Crime and the fear of crime are both down and the number of offences brought to justice has gone up," she said. "This publication provides a clear picture of police performance designed to enable forces to identify strengths and weaknesses and to help local communities understand the performance of their force."Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC), Sir Ronnie Flanagan, said the latest assessments gave a more rounded and comprehensive picture of force performance."While the service can be proud of the progress made during the past year, many challenges lie ahead, in some cases at individual force level and in others at a service wide and structural level," he said.The report identified the police's handling of calls from the public and also issues of race and diversity as areas in which improvements could be made.In the category of reducing crime, only two forces - Humberside and Northamptonshire - were assessed as poor. In the promoting safety category, which includes dealing with anti-social behaviour and road traffic safety, the Metropolitan police, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire were rated as poor.n the providing assistance category, which includes frontline policing and motorway policing, Cheshire, Humberside and South Yorkshire were found to be poor.The top-performing force, West Mercia, was found to be excellent in investigating crime and resource use, and good in all five of the other categories.The assessments also measured whether forces were improving or deteriorating in each of the seven categories. Overall, Hampshire and West Yorkshire were the most improved forces, judged to have improved in each of the seven categories measured; Dyfed Powys and Gwent were the least improved.In London the Metropolitan police said the tables were a "useful" tool but added that it had "reservations" over their ability to take into account the size and complexity of the force."No other force deals with the unique range of policing issues, including the international, national and capital city functions, faced by the MPS," said Len Duvall, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority.The HMIC's previous performance assessments, published in June last year, named the two forces criticised in the wake of the Soham murders - Humberside and Cambridgeshire - among the worst forces, along with Cleveland, Nottinghamshire and West Yorkshire.Each force was ranked excellent, good, fair or poor in 23 different activities. The best were named as Kent, Lancashire, Northumbria, Staffordshire and Suffolk, with Merseyside and West Midlands also commended.
