The government's senior adviser on antisocial behaviour has apologised for comments she made during an after-dinner speech and been warned about her future conduct, government officials announced today.An investigation was launched after Louise Casey told a an audience at a private event organised by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers that ministers might perform better if they turned up "pissed".She also said that "doing things sober is no way to get things done". "I suppose you can't binge drink anymore because lots of people have said you can't do it. I don't know who bloody made that up - it's nonsense," she told the audience.Ms Casey said she would "deck" Downing Street policy advisers if they kept using jargon when talking to her.She has remained in her job during the week-long investigation by Home Office officials. She took up the role as head of the government's antisocial behaviour unit two years ago, and is said to be one of Tony Blair's favoured civil servants. Mr Blair recently announced that Ms Casey would report directly to him after telling the home secretary, Charles Clarke, he was unhappy with progress on tackling the yob culture.A Home Office spokeswoman said: "The Home Office has investigated the remarks made by Louise Casey at an after-dinner event on June 7. Louise has acknowledged that some of these remarks were ill-judged and inappropriate. She apologised immediately and has been warned about her future conduct."
