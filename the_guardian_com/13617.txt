Abigail Witchalls, the 26-year-old mother who was left paralysed after being stabbed in the neck, has failed to pick out one of the main suspects in the investigation during a photo identity parade, police said last night.Richard Cazaly, a 23-year-old gardener who lived near the scene of the attack, has been a suspect since he killed himself in Scotland a few days after the assault. In one suicide note he wrote: "I'm terribly sorry. I must be two people. I can't remember. But I must have done it."Mrs Witchalls was shown the photograph in hospital yesterday afternoon.A police spokesman said: "Surrey police officers investigating the attempted murder of Abigail Witchalls on 20 April 2005 have now conducted a formal identity parade in which Abigail was shown a photograph of Richard Cazaly along with eight others."Abigail did not pick out Richard Cazaly as the man who attacked her."Abigail is clearly disappointed. However, we have reassured her how difficult it is to identify an offender during a formal identification process."A 25-year-old man from Surrey is also being treated as a suspect by detectives, but DNA tests have so far failed to link either man to the attempted murder.Detective Superintendent Adrian Harper, who is leading the investigation, said police would repeat the identification process. "Another witness who was in the area shortly before the attack will be going through a similar identification process involving the picture of Richard Cazaly," he said."Forensic results to date have not provided any evidence linking a suspect to the attack on Abigail. However there are still a number of exhibits which may provide further forensic opportunities."Detectives drafted in tracker dogs last week in the hope of finding clues, including the weapon with which Mrs Witchalls was stabbed. However, their nine-hour search proved fruitless.Police have also been following up leads from an appeal for information on the BBC's Crimewatch programme which yielded more than 70 calls.
