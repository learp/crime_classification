A nursing sister appeared before magistrates yesterday charged with the attempted murder of five elderly patients. Barbara Salisbury, 47, who worked at Leighton hospital in Crewe, Cheshire, was freed on conditional bail by South Cheshire magistrates.

Detectives checked case notes and the allocation of drugs to patients.A spokesman for Cheshire police said that around last May detectives in Crewe began investigating "a number of issues concerning patient treatment at Leighton hospital. There were concerns about the deaths of five elderly people who had been patients at the hospital and concerns were raised about their treatment prior to death".Ms Salisbury is accused of the attempted murder of James Byrne, 76, in May 1999; Reuben Thompson, 81, between February and March 2002; Frances May Taylor, 88, in March 2002; Frank Owen, 92, also in March 2002; and Bertram Madeley, 76, in April 2002.A spokesman for Leighton hospital, which has 600 beds and employs 2,500 staff, said he could not comment on the police investigation.In 2001 the hospital came seventh from the bottom of in a league table of death rates in English hospitals.A spokeswoman for the Royal College of Nursing said of Ms Salisbury: "She is an RCN member and is represented by solicitors on behalf of the RCN.
