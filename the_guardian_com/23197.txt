A former Sunday school teacher will serve 18 years in jail for murdering her policeman husband and her ex-lover's wife in a cover-up designed to look like suicide.Convicted double killer Hazel Stewart stood impassively in the dock of Coleraine court on Wednesday morning as the minimum sentence was imposed.The 48-year-old mother of two from Coleraine had already been sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of plotting with dentist Colin Howell to poison his wife, Lesley, 31, and her own husband, PC Trevor Buchanan, 32, in 1991.With 52-year-old Howell already serving 21 years after pleading guilty to the crimes last year, Justice Anthony Hart, at Belfast crown court, imposed the term that Stewart, Howell's former lover, must spend behind bars.The judge said: "By its verdict in this case, the jury has accepted that Stewart and Howell were in it together, and her part in the dreadful events of the night, which saw the murder of her husband and of Lesley Howell, was not just that of a passive onlooker, but as an active participant, albeit to a lesser extent than Howell."Buchanan and Lesley Howell were found in a fume-filled garage in the seaside town of Castlerock, County Derry, in May 1991.The Royal Ulster Constabulary believed they had died in a bizarre suicide pact until 18 years later when Howell, apparently racked by guilt and troubled by the death of a son, confessed to church elders that he had murdered the pair and altered the crime scene to look like they had taken their own lives.The dentist gassed his wife as she slept in their Coleraine home with carbon monoxide fumes piped from his car before dumping her body in the boot of the vehicle and driving the 10-minute journey to the Buchanan home to do the same to the policeman. He then took his two victims to nearby Castlerock where he left the car in the garage of his wife's late father and turned on the engine.The jurors in Stewart's 15-day trial unanimously accepted that she knew about the plan in advance and, in the case of her husband, actively facilitated his killing by ensuring he was drugged and allowing Howell into her home. Howell is serving a 21-year prison sentence for his role in the double murder.It is understood the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland is going to conduct an investigation into the original RUC inquiry in 1991 and the police's handling of the case. Among the issues the ombudsman's office will explore will be the presence of photographs of children around Lesley Howell's body at the time she was found dead. The photographs were not of her own children, although the RUC at the time failed to spot this anomaly, which the victims' families say should have made the police more suspicious.
