Trials of a hi-tech camera system that scans car number plates to help police identify criminals have proved so successful that another £15m will be invested in the scheme, the home secretary, David Blunkett, told the home affairs select committee yesterday.The automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras were first introduced in 2002 and are already operating in 23 police forces. A six-month trial in nine forces in England and Wales from 2002-03 helped recover 300 stolen vehicles worth more than £2m, and led to more than 3,000 arrests. The scheme also led to the seizure of drugs worth £100,000 and stolen goods valued at £715,000. To date, police have made nearly 13,500 arrests based on information gleaned from the cameras, which can check up to 3,000 vehicles an hour - even if the targets are hitting 100mph. The infrared-equipped digital cameras - which can be fixed at the side of the road or mounted on vans - are able to capture images even in poor light. Computer software reads the number plates and sends them to target databases. The process from sighting to the sounding of an alert takes no more than four seconds. Suspect vehicles can then be intercepted by police.
