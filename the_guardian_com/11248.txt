A former carer at a Jersey children's home was found guilty today of indecently assaulting teenagers in the 1970s.Gordon Wateridge, 78, was convicted of eight charges of indecent assault and one charge of assault following a trial at Jersey royal court. He was the first person to be charged in connection with the Haut de la Garenne abuse investigation.Wateridge, who worked as a house parent at the home, would repeatedly grope girls' breasts, hug the teenagers inappropriately and kiss them on the neck, the court was told. He indecently assaulted three teenage girls and assaulted one teenage boy.One victim, now 53, repeatedly broke down in tears as she told the court how Wateridge would regularly lean out and grab her and other girls as they walked past the home's snooker table.The woman, who was taken into the home as a teenager after her father unexpectedly died, said Wateridge would push her on to the snooker table and grope her breasts and inner thighs."I remember lying on my back with my feet on the floor. He was pretending to tickle me but from my point of view he was having a good feel. His hands would be moving up and down the inside of my leg," she said.Asked why she had not told anyone about the abuse, she replied: "Because no one would have listened."Outside court, States of Jersey police said they hoped the verdict would bring comfort to Wateridge's victims."Gordon Wateridge, a house parent at Haut de la Garenne, was a sexual bully towards vulnerable young girls in his care. We hope the complainants involved in this trial have received some comfort from the decision reached by the court," said Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell.The court was told that youngsters sent to Haut de la Garenne were vulnerable and suffered from a variety of problems, but Wateridge, then in his 40s, abused his obligation to look after them.Wateridge, who had denied all charges throughout the trial, showed no emotion as the verdicts were returned. He was released on bail but warned by Judge Christopher Pitchers that he faced a custodial term when he is sentenced next month.
