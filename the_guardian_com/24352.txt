A Muslim man who endured years of racial abuse from a British National party activist neighbour was yesterday sentenced to eight years in prison for killing him.Habib Khan, 50, stabbed 52-year-old Keith Brown with a kitchen knife during a violent row outside his home in Normacot, Stoke-on-Trent, in July last year. He was cleared of murder earlier this summer, but convicted of manslaughter. Stafford crown court heard that Khan, described as a "mild and calm-mannered family man", had taken the knife to make Brown release his son from a neck grip. He was sentenced to six and a half years for manslaughter and 18 months for wounding Brown's son, Ashley Barker. The judge, Simon Tonking, ordered that he serve the sentences consecutively. Tonking accepted Khan had acted "in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son", but said: "It is beyond question that, by acting in the way he did, Mr Khan killed Mr Brown unlawfully and, whatever their differences, Mr Brown lost his life. That is a consequence for which Mr Khan must be punished." The court heard the feud began a few years earlier when Khan put in a planning application to build a new house. When permission was granted and building work began, Brown "took steps to obstruct it". Tonking said: "What became obvious as the evidence unfolded, however, is that from time to time, despite denials, both Mr Brown and his son Ashley Barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of Mr Khan's family." Khan's barrister, Simon Drew, said police investigations "came to nothing" because of "failures by the system". Outside the court, Stoke-on-Trent BNP councillor Michael Coleman said the case was an example of "liberal politics".
