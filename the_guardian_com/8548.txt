A man with learning difficulties who collapsed and died at his home after allegedly being baited by youths should have been rehoused earlier, Greater Manchester police said today.Peter Fahy, chief constable, said police had tried to protect David Askew, 64, from Hattersley, and had been working with the council to get him rehoused. "The fact is it's taken too long."The force has voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Phil Corris, managing director of Peak Valley Housing, which manages the estate, said the man's mother, Rose, 98, had been reluctant to move. "Until very recently Mrs Askew wished to remain in the property where she was close to local amenities." Paperwork to move them to a new home had been completed, he said.Neighbours described how the abuse directed at Askew had worsened in recent weeks. They claimed he had been "tormented to death â€“ like bear baiting" at his home. He was called names by children as young as eight who threw eggs and bricks at his house, kicked the door, and took his money and cigarettes.It is thought Askew became agitated when two youths broke down a gate and entered his garden on Wednesday evening. Police were called at 9.40pm after the youths tampered with his mother's mobility scooter and a bin.Officers arrived within nine minutes but discovered Askew collapsed in the garden. There is no evidence he was assaulted.A Greater Manchester police spokeswoman said yesterday: "A postmortem examination into the death of David Askew has proved inconclusive. Further tests will have to be carried out to determine the exact cause of the 64-year-old's death."An 18-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter remains in police custody for questioning."
