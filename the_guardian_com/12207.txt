British child protection workers were "disappointed" yesterday at the news that the former pop star Gary Glitter had his three-year jail term for molesting two girls cut by a judge in Vietnam.Glitter, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, 62, will be freed three months early in August next year as part of an amnesty traditionally given in the run up to Vietnam's Lunar Year celebrations in nine days' time.Gadd, who denied molesting the girls aged 10 and 11 at a villa in the southern city of Vung Tau, was convicted in March last year and subsequently lost an appeal.Christine Beddoe, director of Ecpat UK, the British arm of the international campaign to End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and the Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes, said: "We are disappointed to hear of a reduction. Ecpat UK fully believes that Paul Gadd should serve the fullest sentence in order to protect children in Vietnam and the rest of the world."Gadd served two months in jail in Britain in 1999 after being convicted of possessing child pornography.
