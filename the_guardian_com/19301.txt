Police officers from across Britain were today gathering outside parliament to protest at reforms to the police service proposed by the home secretary, David Blunkett.Today's move marks a new stage in a growing battle between the home secretary and the police. Mr Blunkett has put forward reform plans including an end to traditional overtime payments to officers. He also wants hand over many routine tasks to a new form of community officer. Police officers say that these are unacceptable.Some 5,000 off-duty officers are expected to lobby MPs this afternoon following a meeting this morning between Fred Broughton, the chairman of the Police Federation, and the home secretary. Afterwards Mr Broughton said the officers believed that the police service was "in crisis". "Police officers are here to tell their story from their perspective in their police stations, policing our country," he said. This morning the prime minister's spokesman was conciliatory, stressing that the government wanted to win the police round to the merits of the reforms rather than confront them head-on. However many officers at today's protests warned that officers may choose to strike if Mr Blunkett presses ahead - a move currently banned by law. Meanwhile anti-capitalist protesters joined the police protest, handing out leaflets saying: "We demand a zero-hour week for the police to give them fair times for reading, leisure activities with their friends or perhaps their partners, time for giving vent to their frustrations by making love, and to play football with the local kids and for chats with elderly passers-by, with who they could discuss the meaning of freedom."
