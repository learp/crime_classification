A mother found guilty of murder after killing her brain-damaged son with a lethal heroin injection to end his "living hell" lost her appeal against conviction today.But three court of appeal judges reduced the minimum prison term that Frances Inglis, 58, must serve from nine years to five, describing it as one of the most difficult sentencing decisions faced by the court.In the first case of murder involving a mercy killing to reach the appeal court, Lord Judge said: "We must underline that the law of murder does not distinguish between murder committed for malevolent reasons and murder motivated by familial love."Subject to well-established partial defences, like provocation or diminished responsibility, mercy killing is murder."Inglis, from Dagenham, Essex, had denied murdering Thomas Inglis, 22. She was convicted of murder and attempted murder by a majority verdict of 10-2 at the Old Bailey in January and sentenced to life, with a minimum term of nine years.The jury heard that Thomas had suffered severe head injuries when he fell out of a moving ambulance in July 2007. The court was told that the mother-of-three, who worked as a carer for disabled children, had first tried to end her son's life two months after the accident when he was being treated at Queen's Hospital in Romford. His heart stopped for six minutes but he was revived.She was charged with attempted murder, before successfully trying again in November 2008 after barricading herself in his room at the Gardens nursing home in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, and supergluing the door.Acknowledging the case raised issues that were "immensely sensitive and difficult" and which had attracted "increasing measure of public interest and concern", Lord Judge said the law protected Thomas's life. No one "not even his mother, could lawfully step in and bring it to a premature conclusion"."How the problems of mercy killing, euthanasia, and assisting suicide should be addressed must be decided by parliament, which, for this purpose at any rate, should be reflective of the conscience of the nation," he said."In this appeal we are constrained to apply the law as we find it to be. We cannot amend it, or ignore it."At the appeal hearing Inglis's QC, Alan Newman, said she "was entirely taken up with the belief that Tom was suffering and that he was trapped in a sort of living hell and pain".But Judge said there was "not a scintilla of evidence" she had lost self-control.She had resolved to kill her son within a "very short" time of the accident, before the long-term results of operations and treatment could be known, and was "convinced that she, and she alone, knew what was best for Thomas" to an "obsessive extent".She tried to kill him and then eventually did kill him "with scrupulous and meticulous care"."Perhaps most significantly of all," said the judge, her unsuccessful attempt had led to a deterioration in his condition, and contributed to "the very sorry condition from which, on the day of his death, Thomas was suffering".Though a "decent women, of positive good character", in relation to her son and his injuries "she was resolved that she should relieve him of his suffering"."When she did so, she knew exactly what she was doing, and why she was doing it, and how it was to be done, and how it was imperative that its success should be assured." Far from lacking or losing control, an "essential" ingredient for the defence of provocation, she was "completely in control of herself". Judges ruled her appeal against conviction was not arguable.Inglis's condition of depression and post traumatic stress disorder diminished her ability to view her son's condition in an objective way, he said ."She has never felt any sense of guilt or remorse, and she was and remains convinced that, irrespective of what anyone else might think, her son's life had to be brought to an end."Her mental responsibility for her actions was diminished "to an extent that reduced her culpability", he added. "But her culpability was reduced, not extinguished."Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said after the hearing: "Whilst we do not condone Mrs Inglis's actions, given that she directly ended her son's life without his consent, it is clear that her motives were selfless, and we do not think that her actions should be unduly punished because murder law is not equipped for compassion."We are therefore heartened by the news that her sentence has been reduced."
