Judges have sparked a "constitutional crisis" by their decision to quash the government's control orders, the chair of the home affairs select committee claimed today.A key plank of the government's anti-terror legislation is now in legal limbo after a high court judge ruled yesterday that orders confining suspects to their home and curtailing who they can meet breach the European Convention on Human Rights.Today John Denham, a former minister and highly respected backbencher, put the blame firmly at the door of the judges and demanded urgent talks between politicians and the judiciary to resolve the situation before it escalated any further.Mr Denham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is a constitutional crisis emerging here, I think, about the way in which the judges and the courts are approaching these issues."When many of us, as I did, supported the Human Rights Act and indeed still support it, we thought that on great matters of state of this sort - if the elected parliament had taken a careful view of what was in the wider public interest - that would be given considerable weight by the courts."That doesn't seem to be what's happening at the moment and that's why I don't think it's over- the-top to talk about an emerging constitutional crisis."We have got to have a serious discussion between lawmakers in parliament, ministers and judges about the way through here."I know that when Charles Clarke was home secretary he was deeply frustrated that senior judges would not discuss these issues of principle with him."And I think before we get into too big a conflict, sensible people have got to get round the table and explore the way in which this is going to be handled."He added: "This is not a battle between government and the judiciary; this is between the elected parliament and the judiciary."We now know, from last year's London bombings, that the police and security services are taking life and death decisions about who to keep under surveillance."And if you don't have mechanisms of this sort for people you believe to be dangerous then it is difficult to protect the security of the public in the way we want."The home secretary John Reid has already indicated he will seek to overturn the control order ruling on appeal.If the High Court decision stands, human rights lawyers say the government will have to go back to the drawing board.Mr Denham said he could see no alternative to some form of control order."If effective control orders are struck down...I think that probably means that the people go back into the pool of people we are concerned about and the security services will take very difficult decisions about who not to keep an eye on, and let's just hope they choose the right people and not the wrong people."The MP said judges in the rest of Europe gave greater weight to public policy that had been "properly considered and endorsed by parliament"."We need to have a debate - and it's going to require exceptional leadership from ministers, exceptional leadership from the Lord Chief Justice - to say 'how in our system do we get the proper balance right between the judges' job of protecting the individual against arbitrary decisions and giving proper weight where parliament, as in this case, wasn't coming up with the best solution but the least worst solution?'."The human rights barrister Michael Mansfield QC rejected Mr Denham's "crisis" warning, insisting judges were simply doing their job."We are not on the verge of a constitutional crisis; what we are on the verge of is recognising at long last that the courts are performing the role they were always there to do."Although the government has been elected, the elected democracy has put in place a judiciary whose job it is to monitor the extent to which legislation is incompatible with human rights."That's exactly what the judges are doing and as soon as they do their job then in comes the government and says 'oh we don't like this, we wish to lock up people we think are suspects and subversive'."We can't tolerate a society in which a government is allowed that view untrammelled."The six men, who must not be identified, were all single Iraqi nationals whose claims for asylum have been dealt with or have yet to be determined.They were arrested under the anti-terrorism laws but then released without charge.Instead, control orders were made against them. One was allowed to live in his own home but the others were required to live at designated addresses away from their home areas.They were obliged to remain indoors for 18 hours a day, between 4pm and 10am, and were subject to other severe restrictions.
