The family of a Scottish journalist killed in New Zealand have spoken of their disappointment at the jury's verdict in the trial of two men accused of murdering him.Phillip Cottrell, a Radio New Zealand journalist who previously worked for the BBC in Scotland, was found unconscious in a Wellington street in December last year. He died the following day in hospital from his injuries.Two men - Nicho Waipuka, 20, and Manuel Robinson, 18 - were charged with his murder and during their trial each man blamed the other. The jury decided that Waipuka was guilty of manslaughter. Robinson was acquitted. Waipuka will be sentenced in February.Cottrell's sister, Sue Hollows, said afterwards: "Nothing would have brought Phillip back. However, we are extremely disappointed with the outcome."But she thanked police and the prosecutor, adding: "We don't hold it against the jury - it's just the system." Cottrell, 43, worked as a news editor at Radio New Zealand after emigrating to the country in 2006. He had previously worked for the BBC in Glasgow.Sources: BBC/Radio NZ/Dominion-Post
