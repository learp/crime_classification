Lawyers for Sion Jenkins today denied that he is claiming compensation after serving six years in prison for murdering his teenage foster daughter before a court ruled the conviction unsafe.Mr Jenkins, 49, was reported in the Daily Mail to have submitted a compensation claim to the Home Office for up to £500,000 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal after being accused of murdering 13-year-old Billie-Jo Jenkins.The teenager was found bludgeoned to death with a tent peg at the Jenkins family home in Lower Park Road, Hastings, East Sussex, on February 15, 1997.Mr Jenkins, former headteacher-designate at all-boys William Parker School in Hastings, maintained his innocence throughout a protracted legal battle which included three murder trials and two appeals, and culminated in his formal acquittal last February.Solicitors for Mr Jenkins denied as "entirely false" suggestions in today's Daily Mail that he suing the Home Office."Mr Jenkins has not submitted an application for compensation to the Home Office. Reports that he has done so in The Daily Mail are entirely false. This has been verified by the Home Office," the law firm Bindman and Partners said in a statement.A Home Office spokeswoman refused to discuss individual cases but confirmed that claims for miscarriage of justice are covered under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and are the responsibility of the department.Mr Jenkins was convicted of Billie-Jo's murder at Lewes crown court in 1998 and served six years of a life sentence until the court of appeal ruled in 2004 that his conviction was unsafe.The jury was unable to reach a verdict during a retrial the following year. The jury in a second retrial also failed to agree a verdict last February and Mr Jenkins was freed. The Crown Prosecution Service ruled out another retrial.Mr Jenkins, who now lives in Lymington, Hampshire, with his second wife, Christina Ferneyhough, insisted that Billie-Jo must have been murdered by an intruder as she painted the patio doors while he visited a DIY store. Following his release last year, Mr Jenkins' lawyer, Neil O'May, a partner at Bindman and Partners, confirmed they were examining two areas of possible action."There is the issue of compensation from the Home Office for the lost years and which would be based on a miscarriage of justice. Then there may be civil proceedings against the police for their failure to carry out their public duties," he told the Observer.A spokesman for Sussex police today said the threat of civil action had yet to be carried out."We have received no [compensation] claim from Sion Jenkins. As far as we are concerned, it is a matter for the Home Office," he said.A statement on the Justice for Sion Jenkins website says: "It is impossible to put a true value on all that Sion Jenkins has lost since he was first wrongly accused of murder. He was the victim of a legal system which got it wrong."Yet despite the depth of the suffering inflicted on him, and even though his case is recognised as a major miscarriage of justice, the system is now doing its utmost to deny him compensation."A source told today's Daily Mail: "He could have been a highly successful and very well-paid headteacher now and that would have put him in an extremely high income bracket. He does not consider a compensation package nearing £500,000 unreasonable."Mr Jenkins was divorced by his wife, Lois, following his conviction in 1998 before she moved to Tasmania with the couple's four daughters.
