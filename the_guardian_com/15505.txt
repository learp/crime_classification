The siege in Hackney, north London, which ended last night after the discovery of a body inside the fire-damaged rooms, is believed, at 15 days, to have been the longest in British police history.Previously that record was held by a 14-day stand-off in Hull in 1995, involving gunman Steven Wood and two female hostages. It was resolved after power and fuel supplies were cut off to the house on Hull's Orchard Park Estate, where Woods held his hostages at gunpoint. A 12ft barricade was erected around the house - both protecting armed officers and emphasising Wood's isolation before he let the women go and gave himself up.The previous longest-running siege in London was in 1984, when the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan People's Bureau in sparked an 11-day standoff. Fletcher died after being hit by a shot fired from the mission in St James's Square as she helped control a demonstration against the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, outside the building. Police eventually burst into the mission and the diplomats inside were removed and expelled to Libya.But perhaps the most famous London siege of the last century lasted under 10 hours. It was in Sidney Street, off Mile End road in London's East End in January 1911, and ended with two fugitive Russian anarchists being burned to death inside the house they were hiding in after a gun battle with 1,000 troops.The group, responsible for the deaths of three policemen, had holed themselves up in the house and engaged in a fierce gunfight with police and troops before a fire was spotted. The then home secretary, Winston Churchill, who had taken charge of the scene himself, stopped the fire brigade going in immediately, and two charred bodies were later discovered. One member of the anarchist group escaped but was later believed to have been executed in Russia.
