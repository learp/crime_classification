Tony Martin will not be happy with the scene which will greet him when he finally returns to his remote Norfolk farmhouse, the aptly named Bleak House. His home, which was dilapidated enough four years ago when he opened fire on two burglars, has fallen further into ruin.It is difficult to find the front door, so overgrown is the garden, and the farmyard is full of rusting bits of agricultural machinery. Martin's beloved apple trees are also showing signs of neglect, the orchard floor covered with the remains of four seasons' rotting fruit.His mood is not likely to improve when he speaks to friends and neighbours in the hamlet, Emneth Hungate, near Wisbech. Despite the fierce debate on rural crime and policing which followed the ill-fated burglary, they will tell him that precious little has changed.They do not feel any safer and do not believe their area, deep in the Fens, is being better policed. Extra money provided by the government after the shooting in August 1999 ran out in March.Martin will also realise that the debate on the amount of force householders are entitled to use to defend their property has not advanced in the way he would want.If he acted again as he did in August 1999 - and it is not clear that he would not - the result would be the same: another prosecution, another jail sentence.Despite government noises since the case hit the headlines and he was lionised by some tabloids, the Home Office said yesterday only that it was still consulting on the issue.Media roundMartin's immediate future, at least, is clear. Once he is officially released on Monday he will be taken into the custody of the Mirror, which has bought the rights to his story. He will explain that he is sorry that 16-year-old Fred Barras died but still does not accept that he acted wrongly.Martin, a 58-year-old bachelor, may also do a round of television interviews for the British and foreign markets. There has been interest in his story in Europe, Australia and, especially, the US, where the actor and gun lobbyist Charlton Heston has expressed support.He is reported to have plans to write a book - working title My Right to Kill - which the author and former armed robber John McVicar is hoping to edit.But he has made it clear that he wants to return to Bleak House as quickly as possible, though the police continue to take seriously threats that his enemies will try to avenge Barras's death.He is likely to find it difficult to settle back to the quiet life. For one thing, some will expect him to become a spokesman on crime issues. His MP, Henry Bellingham, has said he expects Martin to head a campaign in support of the victims of burglaries.With the best will in the world Martin, who was described in a probation report as "not living in the 21st century", is an unlikely political figure.And he certainly cannot be regarded as a moral guardian: three appeal court judges said the jury was "surely correct" to decide that he had not acted reasonably, and reduced his sentence only on the grounds that he was suffering from a paranoid personality disorder when he opened fire.Martin will be back in the limelight next year when he fights an attempt by Barras's accomplice Brendon Fearon to sue him for damages in the high court. He will be happy, at least, that the government says it intends to introduce an amendment to the criminal justice bill to stop burglars suing their victims.Invisible changesBut has anything changed in the Fens?There is no doubt that the police in Norfolk have tried to improve things, to make people in places like Emneth safer.After the Martin case the Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire police forces were given a Â£600,000 grant by the Home Office to tackle rural crime.The money was invested in the Fens Project, the main aims of which were to get officers to more crime scenes quicker, improve the way the forces share and analyse intelligence, target the worst offenders, and provide mobile police stations.Norfolk police claim success. They say that in the first 18 months of the project, the forces were at the scene of a crime within 24 hours 92% of the time. The detection rate rose in the same period, albeit slightly. But, to the forces' despair, the government money has run out, though for the moment they are continuing to fund the project from their already stretched budgets.Most of Martin's relatives, friends and neighbours do not feel that the policing has improved noticeably since the burglary. Some say they would act as Martin did.His cousin Wendy Mitcham, whose own home in a village near Wisbech was recently targeted, said: "It's OK for politi cians to talk about what they would have done in Tony's place. They don't know what it's like."One villager said: "I don't feel any more secure in my house."The feeling is that if you report a road accident, the police are there in droves within minutes but if you report a burglary, it's the next day."Earlier this week the police were at Martin's home installing CCTV cameras on the property in preparation for his release.Despite the discomfort - and possible dangers - of living at Bleak House, he has told friends to expect to see him back there within a few weeks.His friend Malcolm Starr said: "I think he feels he will be a prisoner for the rest of his life if he tries to run from threats. Besides, he's worried about his apples."
