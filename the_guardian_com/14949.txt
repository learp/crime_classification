A teenage girl was yesterday charged with the murder of a schoolgirl at a birthday party on Saturday night.Charlotte Polius, 15, was stabbed in the neck at a friend's 16th birthday party in Ilford, east London. She was taken to King's College hospital, but died from her injuries. Police have yet to establish a motive for the killing, but believe that violence flared when a crowd of uninvited guests gatecrashed the party in a marquee, shortly after midnight. After the stabbing, the alleged attacker fled the party and was chased by guests through the streets before her pursuers flagged down a passing police car. The 17-year-old suspect from Dagenham, who has not been named, is due to appear in court today. DCI John Macdonald appealed for witnesses. He said: "If parents know or suspect that their son or daughter was at the party, can they ensure that they contact police on their child's behalf." Anyone with information is asked to telephone the police on 020 8345 3985 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
