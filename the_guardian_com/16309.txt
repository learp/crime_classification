The largest boost in police recruitment for many years was yesterday welcomed by the home secretary but he conceded that overall police numbers were still below the level when Labour came to power in 1997.Home Office figures released yesterday showed that 7,009 recruits entered residential police training colleges in the last 12 months, compared with 3,963 recruits during 1999/2000 - a rise of 77%. The rise is largely the result of a Â£450m boost in resources for recruitment after rows over police numbers. Jack Straw had promised to increase recruitment by 9,000 extra officers over the next three years over and above the plans of chief constables. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, claimed the government was comparing the new figures with "an all-time low" in recruitment. "Having let the number of regulars fall and the number of specials fall throughout their term of office they now suddenly turn round one month before an election and say 'oh look we've got record numbers', " she said. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said: "More police officers are, of course, welcome. But better figures in the last month before the general election can't make up for four years of inadequate funding, belated interest and broken promises by this Labour government." Mr Straw said the recruits would very quickly boost overall police numbers, which "went down from 1993 under the four years of the Conservative government and then they went down under the first three years of this government".
