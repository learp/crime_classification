A motorist shot dead in his car in Sheffield has been named by police as Safrajur Rahman Jahingir, 23. He was shot twice in his silver Vauxhall Corsa in the Parson Cross area of the city on Friday, South Yorkshire police said. Detectives are questioning three men in connection with the murder.After he was shot, Jahingir lost control of his car, narrowly missing a bus, and crashed into bushes at about 10.45pm. The bus driver rushed to help and was joined by a paramedic, but Jahingir was pronounced dead. A postmortem examination revealed he died from two gunshot wounds. Police have appealed for sightings of a red Seat Leon hatchback car seen leaving the scene. Three men, aged 28, 33 and 36, were arrested in raids at different locations across Sheffield.Last night Jahingir's family issued a statement, saying: "He was kind and considerate and had time for everyone. He would joke and laugh with elders and young alike."It just doesn't seem believable that anyone would want to hurt him in any way. Our family is devastated. We ask that we be left to grieve at this difficult time."
