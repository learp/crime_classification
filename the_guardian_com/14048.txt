Two of the UK's most notorious serial killers, Ian Brady and Dennis Nilsen, have refused to cooperate with a Metropolitan police study of mass murderers.Scotland Yard hopes the research will establish profiles and patterns to aid future investigations. But Moors murderer Brady, who killed five children, and Nilsen, who killed 16 men in London, have refused to participate. In a letter from Ashworth psychiatric hospital on Merseyside, Brady, 66, wrote: "Research conducted by the penal authorities is self-serving ... an exercise in pretension and time-serving by the tea and biscuit-munching professional drones." Nilsen, 57, said he would "never agree to it" because the Home Office had blocked publication of his autobiography. "I have spilled my guts out in three volumes and that is it," he wrote to a friend. Professor David Canter, of Liverpool University's centre for investigative psychology, said serial killers would probably not be able to shed light on their crimes, even if they did cooperate. "If they had any real insight, would they really have done these things?" he asked.
