Two men and a woman were arrested yesterday in connection with the murder of a 21-year-old office clerk whose battered body was found on Easter Day a mile from her home in Manchester.The men, both 22, and the 20-year-old woman are being questioned by detectives in Greater Manchester. A 19-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Lucy Royle, youngest of five sisters, was beaten and stabbed repeatedly in the back by someone she had arranged to meet after leaving her home in the Davyhulme area. Her body was found on waste ground near the Trafford shopping centre by a man walking his dog. Lucy's mother appealed for help in the hunt for the killer and said her family had been devastated by her death. "Lucy was a very generous, loving and trusting person and also had a mischievous side to her. She was happy spending most of her time at home, especially since all her sisters and nephews and nieces were always around. "We still can't believe that she has gone. The whole family is devastated by what has happened and it is going to take us a long time to come to terms with it, if we ever can.". Police believe she was killed by a man she had arranged to meet. Detective Superintendent Peter Minshall described the murder as "a horrific attack on a defenceless young woman who suffered appalling injuries". He added: "Lucy was viciously attacked and suffered horrendous head injuries. Then, as she was lying fatally wounded, she was repeatedly stabbed in the back. This was a cowardly, brutal, senseless crime."
