Prisoners are to be asked to sign contracts on entering jail, pledging to try to go straight on release in return for help with jobs, accommodation, healthcare and benefits.The scheme - mooted by the government's social exclusion unit in 2002 - is intended to help rehabilitate prisoners and focus their minds on forging crime-free lives.Figures show that reoffending costs society at least Â£11bn a year, with former prisoners committing one in five of all crimes and nearly three in every five prisoners reconvicted within two years of being released from prison.The government will unveil the scheme on Wednesday when it outlines the merger of the prison and probation services into a new structure known as the National Offender Management Service.Its five-year blueprint for the service will allow private companies and the voluntary sector to compete for a greater role in running prisons and the probation system. It will also confirm its intention to jail prisoners closer to their homes.Last year Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, signalled the government's intention to create a new relationship between the prisoners and the state. 'We need to move away from the idea that prisons can be universities of crime towards them being institutions that ensure offenders become working and productive members of society upon release,' he said. 'We have to make reducing the number of re-offenders the central focus of our policy and practice ... It is essential if we are to cut crime.'Clarke said he wanted to devise a system built around 'a form of contract between the criminal and the state where each individual in prison, on remand or on probation is required to commit to a non-criminal future, to no future reoffending'.He believed such a programme would have public support 'because people want to believe that when offenders leave the criminal justice system they will go back to the straight and narrow and become constructive contributors to the good of society as a whole'.Last night prison reform campaigners welcomed the plan but said the government would have to fulfil its side of the contract. 'Contracts work both ways,' said Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, but it sounded 'very didactic and proscriptive'.'If you're going to have this sort of contract, you really do have to ensure someone released from prison gets help finding housing rather than ending up in a night shelter.'
