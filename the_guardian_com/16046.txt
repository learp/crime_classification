Two men were cleared yesterday of taking part in a gunpoint attack on a director at the Championship football club Queens Park Rangers.Gianni Paladini, 60, claimed that he was punched and threatened with a pistol after being ambushed by his fellow director David Morris and six others in an attempted takeover bid at the club's west London ground.The Italian-born tycoon and QPR shareholder said he was forced to sign a resignation letter handing over his club shares during a match against Sheffield United on August 13 last year.But a jury at Blackfriars crown court in London yesterday cleared Mr Morris, 50, of Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, and John McFarlane, 39, of Hayes, Middlesex, of involvement in the attack. The pair were acquitted of conspiracy to blackmail, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, all of which they had denied. The jury has still to reach verdicts on the four remaining defendants and Judge Charles Byers sent the jurors home, asking them to resume their deliberations next Wednesday.The other defendants who all deny conspiracy to blackmail, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence are Andy Baker, 40, of North Petherton, Somerset; Aaron Lacey, 36, of Watford, Hertfordshire; David Davenport, 38, of Chesham, Buckinghamshire; and Michael Reynolds, 45, of Wood Green, north London. A seventh defendant, Barry Powell, 34, of Greenford, Middlesex, was acquitted last month.Mr McFarlane left court without comment but Mr Morris read out a short statement in which he thanked his wife Angela, family, friends and legal team for their "support over a very difficult 10 months". Mr Morris said he was happy that the jury had reached "true and just verdicts of not guilty".
