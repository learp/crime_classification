The government is to introduce a bill to allow inquest juries to hear secret phone tap evidence after the family of a 24-year-old unarmed black man who was shot dead by police threatened legal action.A coroner has ruled that it was impossible to hold an inquest into the death of Azelle Rodney, who was killed by the Metropolitan police in April 2005 - three months before Jean Charles de Menezes - because of the amount of blacked out material which could not be seen by the jury. The current law makes it a criminal offence for the Met to give secret material obtained from intercepts to the coroner.Rodney's mother, Susan Alexander, had been seeking a court ruling that the inability to find out how her son died at the hands of police breached his right to life under the European convention of human rights.A Home Office spokeswoman said yesterday: "The government is aware of the issues raised by this inquest and it recognises that in a very small number of inquests a change to the law may be required. It is proposing to legislate as soon as is practicable."Daniel Machover, the family's solicitor, said the move could be a first step towards making intercept evidence admissible at criminal trials. Britain is one of a few countries to ban such evidence in the criminal courts, but a government working party is looking at a possible change in the law.Inquest juries can deliver verdicts of unlawful killing, which could be followed by a criminal prosecution. Changing the law for inquests but not for trials would mean a trial jury would be banned from hearing the evidence the inquest jury heard.Alexander called for all-party support to get the legislation through as soon as possible. She said: "For a long time now I've been very frustrated and upset by not being able to see vital evidence about the police shooting of my son."Now that the government agrees that this evidence shouldn't be withheld from bereaved families like ours, I hope all concerned can act quickly so the evidence is disclosed with minimum delay. Azelle has not had justice and without justice there can be no accountability."Rodney was shot six times by Scotland Yard's CO19 armed unit in a suburban road in Edgware, north London, after a car in which he was travelling was stopped by police who had had it under surveillance.After an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone.
