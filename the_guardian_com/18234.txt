Prison officers and governors fear that a cost-saving plan to lock up tens of thousands of inmates from Friday lunchtimes to Monday mornings across England and Wales will spark control problems, particularly in high-security jails.Prison Service managers have privately acknowledged they will have to extend the provision of in-cell televisions as the pay-off for the early lockdown scheme.The Prison Service has confirmed that all afternoon activities on Fridays inside public sector prisons, including education, skills training and offender management courses, are to be cancelled from April in an attempt to find £30m a year in Treasury-imposed efficiency savings.The introduction of a "standard core day" was spelled out to governors in an internal Prison Service memo by the operations director, Michael Spurr, last week. He said it would apply to medium- and high-security closed prisons and institutions which hold young people aged 18 to 21.The scheme would not apply to low-security open prisons, many of whose inmates work outside the prison on weekdays, and those managed by the Youth Justice Board and holding under-18s.A spokesman said: "Like all government departments, the Prison Service is required to look at efficiency savings. We are maximising our use of resources to deliver a safe and decent regime."The Prison Service said the timetable would allow for 10 hours of activity on Mondays to Thursdays, 8½ hours on Fridays and eight hours on weekend days. The decision means that £30m a year will be saved in overtime pay to officers who provide Friday afternoon activities.The Prison Governors Association has already warned that the decision to lock up prisoners for half a day longer will mean inmates spend more hours "banged up" than they did in 1969.Glyn Travis of the Prison Officers' Association said prison officers were alarmed by this "quite draconian" decision.He feared the policy was "doomed for disaster" when it is introduced in volatile, overcrowded prisons in April. "We have not had any major disturbances in prisons for several years," he said. "When you take something away from prisoners they react."Prison Service managers are believed to be anxious about the reaction of long-term inmates in high-security jails.Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust said the decision further reduced prisons to the "people warehouses" they are becoming. "When self-harm and suicide levels are rising, it is especially worrying to see the Prison Service ... preparing to consign prisoners to longer, lonely periods behind bars," she said.
