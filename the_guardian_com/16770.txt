An official report released today into the deaths of three yachtsmen has blamed the tragedy on a large ferry which travelled too close, despite the ferry's captain being cleared of all charges relating to the incident.The Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the ferry, the Pride of Bilbao, had either collided with the 27ft yacht Ouzo or passed so close the vessel had been swamped by its wash.Earlier today, Michael Hubble was acquitted of three remaining charges that he endangered the lives of the three men who died after their boat sank off the Isle of Wight.Yesterday Hubble, the officer of the watch in charge of the P&O car ferry at the time the Ouzo vanished, was found not guilty of their manslaughter. The jury were not allowed to see the MIAB report for legal reasons.During the trial, Hubble, who had 42 years' experience at sea, maintained that he had a close-quarters incident with a yacht but that it was not the Ouzo.In the witness box, he said he was "perfectly happy" that his vessel had missed a yacht and that he had no reason to call the captain. He claimed unusual manoeuvres he made were only to give the yacht room and he did not consider it an emergency.The jury also heard that experts from South Tyneside college calculated that the Ouzo was close to a 3,000-tonne tanker called Crescent Beaune, and not the Pride of Bilbao, at the time it went missing.But the MAIB report said: "After careful analysis of the facts, the MAIB is of the firm opinion that the yacht was Ouzo and that the Pride of Bilbao had collided with her, or passed so close that she had been swamped or capsized by the vessel's wash."The report went on to say that Hubble had made "a serious error of judgment" in not calling the master when he passed close by what they said was the Ouzo.Hubble was acquitted after jurors were unable to reach verdicts on charges under the Merchant Shipping Act that his conduct was likely to have caused death or injury to the three men.James Meaby, Jason Downer and Rupert Saunders died when the Ouzo sank in August last year. Hubble, 62, was yesterday found not guilty of their manslaughter.It was accepted that the 37,500-tonne ferry passed very close to a yacht at around the time the Ouzo disappeared. The prosecution claimed that yacht was the seven-metre (23ft) long Ouzo and it was either knocked over or swamped by the giant ferry. It was alleged that the men could have been saved had the alarm been raised. Instead, the prosecution claimed, Hubble hoped for the best and steamed on towards northern Spain.Hubble remained impassive as yesterday's verdict clearing him of manslaughter through gross negligence came back, and simply bowed his head.Today the jury at Winchester crown court told the judge, Mr Justice Owen, it was unable to reach verdicts on the alternative counts after seven days of deliberation.The prosecution barrister, Christopher Parker QC, told the court it was not in the public interest to seek a retrial on the charges. The judge then formally entered not guilty verdicts and told Hubble he was free to go.During the six-week trial, the jury heard that the three men, who were school and university friends, left Bembridge on the Isle of Wight on the evening of August 20 heading to Devon to take part in the Dartmouth regatta.Saunders, 36, from Tooting, south London, was the skipper of the Ouzo, a vessel that was 24 years old but well-maintained. Meaby, also 36 and from Tooting, and Downer, 35, from Kent, were also competent and keen sailors.All three were found dead with their inflated lifejackets on. Meaby is believed to have remained alive in the cold, dark water for at least 12 hours, while the other men are thought to have survived at least three hours.
