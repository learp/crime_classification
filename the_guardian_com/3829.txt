The mother of the missing five-year-old girl April Jones has made a heart-wrenching appeal for information about her daughter.Trying desperately to hold back her tears, Coral Jones, 40, said: "It's been 36 hours since April was taken from us. There must be someone out there who knows where she is and can help the police find her."We are desperate for any news. April is only five years old." Her voice broke as she said: "Please, please, help find her." Jones then collapsed into tears and buried her head in her hands.She was flanked by the officer leading the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, and April's grandfather, Dai Smith, during the police press conference in Aberystwyth, mid-Wales.Earlier police took the unusual step of releasing the name and a photograph of the man they have arrested on suspicion of her abduction.The man arrested on Tuesday afternoon was named as 46-year-old Mark Leonard Bridger, who lives close to April's family home in Machynlleth.Bevan said police were continuing to question him about the disappearance of the girl, who has not been seen since she was apparently snatched as she played in the street with friends at about 7pm on Monday.Bevan also produced an image of a Land Rover – registration L503 MEP – that has been seized by officers and is being examined.Appealing for help from the public, Bevan said police were trying to piece together Bridger's movements from 5pm on Monday until his arrest at 3.30pm on Tuesday.He confirmed that Bridger was arrested just north of the Dyfi bridge, around a mile from Machynlleth town centre. He was walking towards the town.Bevan said the suspect was wearing a green camouflage jacket and black waterproof trousers over camouflage trousers. The Land Rover was found at a nearby repair garage.The detective said: "We are pursuing a number of lines of inquiry, one of which is Mark Bridger."He asked people to look carefully at the images of Bridger and the vehicle and come forward if they had seen anything. "Please don't assume that someone else has contacted us," he added.Extra officers and mountain rescue teams are being drafted in to search for April in a "methodical and systematic" search, police said earlier.Superintendent Ian John, the local police commander, said he hoped that as the day went on, more information would come from Bridger, who is known to April's family.John said: "I'm afraid to say I don't have any news on April's whereabouts but we continue to pursue the search areas. As today goes on and further interviews with the person in custody take place we anticipate intelligence coming out of those interviews which are going to drive where the police search operation will go."He said Machynlleth and the surrounding areas continued to be the main focus for the search.April's family on Wednesday confirmed reports that she has cerebral palsy but declined to comment further.
