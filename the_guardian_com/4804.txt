The justice secretary, Jack Straw, indicated today that he may reveal more about the recall to prison of Jon Venables, one of the killers of the toddler James Bulger.He defended his decision against offering more details so far, which he said had been necessary in order to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system and to avoid prejudicing any future court hearing.In her first television interview since Venables's recall, James's mother, Denise Fergus, expressed her anger at the way the situation had been handled. But she said she was prepared to wait for the information she has been demanding.Straw was responding to pressure from the public and media to reveal specific details of why the 27-year-old, released under a new identity in 2001 on a licence whose terms he has allegedly breached, was back in jail.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "What I want to do is look at what has already been made public ... to look at that and then to make a judgment about if there's information – given that it's already out in the newspapers – we can confirm."Straw's comments followed a number of reports over the weekend that purported to reveal the reasons Venables was recalled and details of his life outside prison. The Sunday Mirror said he had been returned to prison in connection with child pornography offences. Other reports said Venables had been known to drink heavily and use drugs, and had revealed his true identity to others.Straw has agreed to meet Fergus, who has criticised the failure to disclose the reasons for the recall. He said he intended to give her "as much information as possible" and acknowledged that any information he divulged to her would subsequently become public.Last week, Straw said Venables had been jailed in relation to "extremely serious allegations" but it was not in the public interest to reveal the specific nature of the breach.Fergus told ITV1's This Morning that the whole episode had been "a massive blow" and she had not been eating. She accused the government of treating the issue "like a football, kicking it one to another" and said she didn't expect to get satisfactory answers from her meeting with Straw.When pressed on the prospect of any new case against Venables being prejudiced by the publication of details of his breach, Fergus said: "I am prepared to wait a bit longer"."Once it's all done and dusted, will I then get to know the full details of what they have done during the nine years [since their release]?"Fergus, 42, called for the person responsible for supervising Venables to be sacked and said she wanted to be in the courtroom if her son's killer faced another trial.The justice secretary said today that Venables had not been charged with any offence but was under investigation."The judgment I made, on very clear advice from others who were directly involved in the investigation, is that it [releasing more information] could be prejudicial," Straw said.He acknowledged public frustration but said that criticism of the government would have been "much more profound" had the chances of Venables going back to court been scuppered by the release of prejudicial details of his alleged offence.Straw rejected the idea that he could have denied inaccurate reports in the media, insisting that such actions would have merely led to more theories being put forward and would not have put an end to speculation.Venables and Robert Thompson, then both aged 10, lured two-year-old James away from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in February 1993, and battered him to death. Under the terms of their release, they must adhere to a series of strict conditions, including that they never make contact with each other or return to Liverpool.At the time of the trial, Venables was viewed as the more hopeful case for rehabilitation, because he was apparently more remorseful than his co-accused.
