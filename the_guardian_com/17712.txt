The Home Office should be stripped of responsibility for publishing crime statistics because public trust in the figures has been eroded, partly by departmental manipulation of their timing and context, the government's official statistics watchdog has ruled.The deeply embarrassing finding by the Statistics Commission follows a long debate between the commission, the Home Office and the government's official national statistician. Trends in crime figures have always been one of the great battlegrounds of British politics, with media and political parties often drawing very different conclusions as to whether crime is falling or rising.In response, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, will order a wide-ranging inquiry into crime statistics.He denies departmental manipulation, but accepts the complexity and multiplicity of the figures is a problem. The review - to be announced in January when Mr Clarke publishes the next set of quarterly crime statistics - will also examine whether the statistics should be published independently of the Home Office, and whether new systems of measurement are needed.The proposal to strip the Home Office of responsibility was contained in an interim report issued by the commission just before Christmas. In its report the commission says: "Our impression is that faced with a hostile and at times antagonistic media, the Home Office has sought to contain the flow of statistical messages - prescribing the frequency and form in which these statistics are released, and making sure that policy responses are issued at the earliest possible moment, sometimes ahead of the figures."We believe any such control is almost always counterproductive in terms of public confidence. It creates an environment in which the media and the public assume they are receiving a filtered, government-friendly version of the truth, even though the statistical message may not be either of these things."The commission proposes that the production and release of these statistics and related statistical analysis should in future be at arm's length from government.Crime statistics have been bedevilled by the release of separate statistics, some based on a crime survey and some based on crime recorded by the police. The commission argues that both sets of statistics should be continued, but "careful thought is needed on how they can be brought together to report crime trends and patterns".The commission called for a review of crime statistics after it discovered the Home Office had issued a press release to the media on July 20, the day before the official crime statistics were published.It complained the press statement "was clearly a political statement and not a statistical one. It presents the key statistics alongside the government line that 'it is extremely encouraged by the figures'."It added the incident was in breach of guidelines and so improper that the code of practice on the release of statistics should be fundamentally reviewed and placed on a statutory basis binding on all government departments.
