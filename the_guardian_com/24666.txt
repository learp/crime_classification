   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The NSPCC is following up its joint report with the Met police into Jimmy Savile's activities, Giving victims a voice, with a media campaign called "Don't wait until you're certain"Beginning on Monday, an edited version of the film shown above, originally used last year, will run for six weeks. It urges people to listen to what children are saying and if they are worried about them not to delay in calling the NSPCC helpline and/or ChildLine. The TV campaign will be supported by Facebook advertising and a sponsored trend on Twitter on launch day. It will reinforce a number of key messages stemming from the reason Savile got away with prolonged child abuse:Children weren't listened to or believed; people weren't certain what they were seeing was abuse; and people didn't know what to do if they saw something. Therefore, says the NSPCC, it is vital for people to listen to children and to report concerns immediately, no matter how sure they are.Sources: YouTube/NSPCC See also Child sexual abuse: what we know from practice and research
