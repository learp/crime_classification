Police were today trying to identify two bodies that were found in a burning car parked in a layby last night.The remains were so badly charred that detectives have been unable to work out whether they were male or female or even adult or child.Several motorists raised the alarm at around 11.15pm, saying a vehicle was on fire beside the A47 north of Earl Shilton, in Leicestershire. The two bodies were later found inside.Today, police set up a blue tent around the burnt-out car, which is around 200 metres from the main road. A forensic examination of the scene is due to be carried out later."Because of the ferocity of the fire, identification of the deceased and determining what happened might take some time," a Leicestershire police spokeswoman said. "We are keeping an open mind. It is too early to speculate."Postmortem examinations of the bodies will take place this afternoon in an attempt to discover how the victims died, she added. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious.Jim Driver, who owns a pet food business nearby, said: "There's often quite a lot of traffic around there. Lorries park here, so the drivers may have seen what happened."Further tests will also need to be carried out on the car to determine its make and model.
