A quartet of veteran British actors, led by Michael Caine, are in talks for Working Title’s film about the audacious Hatton Garden robbery.Joining Caine as members of a gang of elderly villains who pulled off the heist in 2015 are Jim Broadbent, Michael Gambon and Ray Winstone. Caine is likely to play Brian Reader, the 76-year-old who was sentenced to six years in jail for his ringleader role in the robbery.Hatton Garden heist: the movie – exclusive leaked script! Already the subject of two low-budget productions, The Hatton Garden Job (directed by Green Street 3 writer Ronnie Thompson) and the as yet uncompleted Hatton Garden Heist (directed by The Guvnors’ Gabe Turner), Working Title’s somewhat more ambitious version will be directed by James Marsh, of Man on Wire and The Theory of Everything renown. It is based on Mark Seal’s Vanity Fair article, The Over The Hill Mob, about the case.Caine had previously expressed interest in a role in the film, saying: “That story, the four guys in Hatton Garden, they are very, very tough ... I’ve heard my name and Ray Winstone’s name mentioned. I would do it in an instant.”
