Appeal judges have almost doubled the jail sentence of a man who filmed himself raping a woman on his iPad.The judges agreed with the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, that the original term imposed on Hesam Khosravi at Minshull crown court in Manchester in January was unduly lenient, and increased it from six to 11 years.It was argued on the attorney general's behalf at the court of appeal in London that six years failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence, the need for deterrence and the "public concern that offences like this give rise to".During the attack in Trafford, Greater Manchester, Khosravi threatened his victim with a knife.The appeal judges were told that other aggravating features of the case included "deliberate and gratuitous violence" and "degradation and humiliation", including the filming of the crime on his tablet computer.The footage was found by police last April after he was arrested for an unconnected offence. Khosravi claimed it was consensual role play, but later pleaded guilty to rape.Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with two other judges, said: "Watching the footage was an extraordinarily unpleasant task. The victim's obvious pain and distress is excruciating to watch. How the victim must feel knowing that the recording has been shown in court and watched by outsiders one cannot imagine."What is particularly chilling is the offender's calm dominance throughout. The offender was determined to terrify and humiliate at the same time. He succeeded. His behaviour that night was simply cruel, and the lasting psychological harm he has caused is immeasurable."During the original sentencing, the judge, Adrian Smith, said Khosravi was a well-educated man from a "decent, supportive family" who had become "violent and frighteningly menacing" during the attack.Robert Lancaster, mitigating, said Khosravi had taken crystal meth before the attack, which had made him more aggressive.Khosravi, 24, an Iranian immigrant, faces deportation when he is released.
