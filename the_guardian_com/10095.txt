Detectives investigating the kidnap and rape of a three-year-old girl in Cardiff believe two men were cruising the neighbourhood all day trying to entice children into their car.The girl was snatched from her home in the Rumney area of the city about 10.30pm on Monday. She was rescued in the early hours of Tuesday after a car pursued by police crashed almost 80 miles away near Marlborough, Wiltshire.Last night, a 26-year-old man was charged with kidnap and four serious sexual offences. Two other men aged 34 and 47 were released without charge.The girl was treated for cuts and bruises and other "significant injuries" suffered before the crash.Police think two men were driving around Llanrumney - the wider area around Rumney - all day in a dark blue Ford Escort on the lookout for a little girl to take and may have approached other children before snatching the three-year-old from her home."We have reason to believe that the two men in question may have attempted to entice young girls into their car at some stage on Monday," said Detective Inspector Paul Kemp.Police are asking anyone who saw the car or the men to call the incident room on 02920 222111 or the confidential Crimestoppers line on 0800 555111.The girl's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the Daily Mirror: "I'm so relieved to get her back. But she's just completely overwhelmed and in shock."
