A 27-year-old woman was charged tonight with the alleged hit-and-run killing of a young boy, Avon and Somerset Police said.Sam Riddall, 11, died after a car mounted the pavement and ran into him as he walked home from a church youth service in Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on 1 May.Tonight, a police spokesman said Hannah Saaf, from Bristol, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop and/or report an accident, driving otherwise than in accordance with her licence and driving without insurance.Saaf has been denied bail and will appear before Bristol Magistrates Court tomorrow morning, the spokesman said.Last week, Sam's parents Martin and Rachel Riddall launched a public appeal for the driver of the car to come forward.The appeal came after Avon and Somerset Police took the unusual step of releasing Saaf's name and image to the public.Sam was walking along Eastfield Road with Dr Peter Harbord, father of one of his friends, and three other children at around 9.15pm on 1 May after leaving a youth club service at the nearby Henleaze and Westbury Community Church.A white Ford Focus estate car was travelling along Eastfield Road towards the centre of the village when it careered off the road, mounted the pavement and hit the group.The three other children involved in the incident, all thought to be aged 11, were uninjured while Dr Harbord received minor injuries and was released from hospital later that evening.Mr Riddall, 45 and his 39-year-old wife, who have three other sons aged five, nine and 14, described Sam as "the most wonderful of boys".Paying tribute, they said: "We miss him very much indeed. And we wish he was here with us every second of the day."
