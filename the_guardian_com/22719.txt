The father of the killer of the schoolboy Rhys Jones has been arrested on suspicion of an arson attack on the home of a fellow gang member of his son.Joseph McCormick, 56, was detained by Merseyside police this week after the home Gary Kays shared with his family in Croxteth Park, Liverpool, was set alight.McCormick was questioned then released on bail, sources told the Press Association.A Merseyside police spokesman confirmed that a 56-year-old man was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of arson and bailed pending further inquiries.Last December McCormick's son, Sean Mercer, was jailed for a minimum of 22 years after being found guilty of the murder of the 11-year-old, one of Britain's youngest victims of gangland violence.The trial heard that Mercer, who was in the Crocky Crew gang, was aiming to shoot rival gang members when he missed, hitting Rhys as he walked home from football practice in August 2007.Kays and other gang members were convicted of assisting an offender after they helped Mercer evade the police for months. Kays was jailed for seven years.Early on Saturday a petrol bomb was thrown through a downstairs window of the home of the Kays.Gary Kays senior and his wife Patricia were on holiday but their daughter was at home. She and her boyfriend put out the fire before the emergency services arrived.As well as helping to ferry Mercer to an industrial lock-up where gunshot residue was washed off him and his clothes burned, Kays junior was responsible for putting Mercer at the murder scene.He phoned his fellow Croxteth Crew gang to tell him rival Norris Green thugs were on their turf. It was his information that led Mercer to the Fir Tree pub where he fired the fatal shots.Throughout his time in the witness box at Liverpool crown court, Kays, who worked at the family firm GK Construction, smirked and tried to dodge the prosecuting lawyer's questions.But he was convicted and is serving his sentence at Wymott jail, Leyland, Lancashire.McCormick was in tears as the verdict was announced, and mouthed "I love you" to his son.
