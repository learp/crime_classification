A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after two women died and another was badly injured in a knife attack at a house in Oxfordshire.Officers were called to a property in Thame at 2.20am on Sunday where two women were found with fatal stab wounds, Thames Valley police said. The third woman was taken to hospital where her condition was thought not to be life-threatening.A police spokesman said a 21-year-old man was being questioned in Abingdon, and nobody else was being sought.Detective Chief Inspector Joe Kidman, the senior investigating officer, said: "We are in the early stages of our investigation. At this time it appears that all parties are known to each other and we are not seeking anyone else in connection with this case."Police and forensic investigators were at the scene and neighbours spoke of their shock. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "All the police have told us is that it's a major incident."Neighbours are saying it is a domestic â€¦ I heard a helicopter flying overheard but I presumed there had been a car accident. It had its searchlight on and, thinking about it now, they must have been looking for someone. People haven't been allowed to take their cars out and that's all I know."A spokeswoman for the ambulance service said an officer and two ambulances were sent to the scene in the early hours of Sunday. Police have not released the ages of the victims; residents said one of the women who died was thought to be in her 20s the and the other in her 50s.
