The man accused of keeping Shannon Matthews prisoner in a flat, tied with a leash when he was out, took her to local supermarkets and parks at the height of a huge police hunt, a court heard yesterday.Michael Donovan, 40, said that he made the trips with the nine-year-old at dusk, taking care that she was wrapped in a bulky coat with the hood up. Donovan claimed that he was threatened with violence by Shannon's mother, Karen Matthews, 33, if he refused to take part in a scam to claim a £50,000 reward. In police interviews after he and Shannon were found hiding under a bed in February, he said the child thanked him for buying toys and being kind - "not like her parents".Donovan and Matthews deny kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice by triggering a £3.2m search for Shannon which lasted 24 days. The schoolgirl disappeared on her way home to the Moorside estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, from a school swimming trip. Leeds crown court heard yesterday that Shannon watched only cartoons on the TV at Donovan's flat in Batley Carr, just over a mile from her home, and knew nothing about the search.Matthews claimed to police that she sent Shannon to stay with Donovan as part of a plan to escape from her partner, Craig Meehan. She said: "He punched doors. When he hadn't got a door to punch he takes it out on me. I just wanted to know how to get him out of my life because I didn't love him any more. I asked Mike for advice. But it just went pear-shaped. It didn't go to plan." The trial continues.
