A female martial arts enthusiast shot dead by police after a stand-off in a car park was named by investigators yesterday.Ann Sanderson, 37, the first woman to die in Britain after being shot intentionally by officers, worked at a newsagents near her home in Sevenoaks, Kent, and at a factory making guitar strings. She was said to have waved a ball-bearing gun at police and refused to drop the weapon in the early hours of Monday morning. A firearm was recovered at the scene, but the Independent Police Complaints Commission said an officer fired the only shot.Shocked residents said Ms Sanderson lived in sheltered accommodation, but did not seem unstable. A neighbour in nearby Edenbridge, where she grew up, said she had been deeply affected as a child when her mother died of cancer.In Sevenoaks, Vivian Bain said: "She was a lovely neighbour. I cannot understand how this happened."Another neighbour said Ms Sanderson had a "quiet" girlfriend who visited at weekends. She listed karate and kickboxing among her interests on Friends Reunited.
