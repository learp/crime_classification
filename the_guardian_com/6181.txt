Nearly one in four children in England and Wales aged 10 to 15 were the victims of crime last year, according to a Home Office survey of the experiences of under 16s.But the first results from the experimental children's British Crime Survey published today reveal that the majority of the 2.1m incidents of theft and violence against young teenagers were no more than playground pushing and shoving or family spats.The 2.1m figure covers all incidents that would be technically classified as a crime in law, whether they happened inside or outside the school playground. When the children were asked whether they considered the incident to be a crime the figure fell to 404,000.The Home Office minister Nick Herbert said the findings reinforced his belief that existing crime measures had offered only a partial or confusing picture about the level of offending.The children's BCS appears to undermine the idea of an explosion in juvenile crime not being picked up by existing crime measures.The survey shows that children face higher levels of violent crime than adults but confirms that most of it is low-level offending that does not involve injury and that the more serious incidents are already being reported to the police.The attempt to fill the gap in British crime statistics by developing a children's BCS has taken nearly two years and the first survey is based on 3,700 interviews with children last year in front of their parents.They were asked about their experience as victims of violence and theft but the questions did not cover issues such as parental abuse, sexual offences and drugs.Home Office statisticians said they were consulting over the final format of the children's BCS and offered four different possible measures that could be used.The first covered incidents that were legally a crime; the second was a "norms-based" measure that excluded low-level incidents such as pushing or shoving; a third included all incidents that were a crime in law but excluded those that happened in school; and a fourth was of those that children said they regarded as a crime. The third measure is closest to the reality of police recording of juvenile crime.The figure of 2.1m crime incidents suffered by 24% of all children aged 10 to 15, based on the first measure of all incidents that are a crime in law, includes examples such as:• A child having their 50p dinner money taken from them at school but subsequently returned to them;• Two siblings playing at home and one of them deliberately smashing the other's toy;• A child being deliberately pushed and shoved in the street but not injured.The detailed figures show that once the number of incidents that happen in school are taken out the overall crime figure falls to 643,000. Home Office statisticians say children suffer far fewer thefts than adults, partly because they own less things of value, and 538,000 of the 643,000 incidents outside school involved violence of some kind.About 83,000 incidents involved some kind of wounding that was serious enough to need medical attention, ranging from a stab wound to a chipped tooth. The findings confirm that boys are nearly twice as likely to be victims of serious personal crime, with those living in the 20% more deprived areas most at risk.Herbert said: "These new figures reinforce our longstanding belief that to date crime measures have offered either a partial or confused picture about the level of offending."However you look at these statistics, they reveal what people know only too well – that crime affecting young people is a serious problem which must be tackled."Herbert said a common sense approach was needed that recognised young people's experiences so they were not criminalised by failing to properly distinguish between playground spats and serious crime.The shadow home secretary, Alan Johnson, welcomed the survey, which he said had been commissioned while Labour was still in power. "It adds to our understanding and further demonstrates that crime including violent crime fell consistently under Labour," he said. "The home secretary must accept the advice of Home Office statisticians and the UK Statistics Authority and tell the truth about the trend in violent crime rather than peddle the fiction which so discredited her Conservative predecessor."
