Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine disappeared in Portugal six months ago, went back to work yesterday and could be back in direct contact with patients within a month.Mr McCann, a Â£75,000-a-year heart specialist at Glenfield hospital in Leicester, will initially work three half-days a week, dividing his time between assessing MRI scans and carrying out research for the British Heart Foundation."We have always said that at six months we didn't want to look back and say 'I wish we had done that and wish we had done this'," said Mr McCann, who has been on unpaid leave since Madeleine went missing in the resort of Praia da Luz."But now we feel we have done everything we can to establish the search for Madeleine on an ongoing basis and we feel we have the proper infrastructure in place to find her. That, in turn, allows me to concentrate on returning to work properly."My colleagues here at Glenfield hospital have been absolutely fantastic in their support for both Kate and I throughout this and I am very pleased to be rejoining them and to get back a degree of normality."As he arrived at the hospital, Mr McCann added: "Unless Madeleine is found, we are not expecting any significant developments in the near future."Asked about Mr McCann's continuing status as an official suspect, Doug Skehan, clinical director of the hospital's cardio-respiratory directorate, said: "This is a colleague who has lost his child and still does not know where that child is. Adding to that woe by making harsh judgments or being directed by external influences would be wrong."On Saturday, Mr and Mrs McCann will mark the six-month anniversary of Madeliene's disappearance by going to church to pray for her.
