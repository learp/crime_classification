A judge and a police officer called yesterday for a review of weapons laws after a former miner was sentenced for killing a neighbour with two Japanese ninja swords and a crossbow bought by mail order.Robert Boyer, 43, who planned the attack and built a food-stacked hideout in Sherwood Forest to lie up in afterwards, was ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act. He had admitted manslaughter after slashing to death 62-year-old Keith Frogson, while in the grip of delusions that the victim was "trying to dismantle his house brick by brick". The court heard that Boyer had bought the weapons legally by answering magazine advertisements and spent hours watching violent films to learn how to use them. Mr Justice Bean told Nottingham crown court yesterday: "I must record my concern that it is possible for a crossbow and a ninja sword to be bought by mail order without any licence being required and without a proper record of who bought them. "I respectfully suggest that this is a matter which the home secretary may wish to consider if legislation is to be introduced in this session of parliament concerning knives and offensive weapons." His call was backed by Detective Chief Inspector Russ Foster of Nottinghamshire police, who led the investigation in July 2004 at the former pit village of Annesley Woodhouse where both men lived. Mr Foster, whose detectives found a pile of weapons magazines in Boyer's house, said: "It is surprising that such weapons as samurai swords and crossbows are so easy to get hold of. I am fully supportive of the judge's recommendations."
