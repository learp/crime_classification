Celebrity publicist Max Clifford is set to go on trial on Thursday accused of indecently assaulting seven alleged victims including a 14-year-old girl.Clifford, 70, will appear at Southwark crown court in London for the start of a four-week trial over 11 counts of indecent assault.The publicist denies the charges, which span from 1966 to 1984, from seven complainants aged from 14 to 19.He was first arrested in December 2012 and charged last April under Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree inquiry.The prosecution case against Clifford is expected to be opened on Thursday morning by Rosina Cottage QC, after a final panel of jurors have been sworn in.Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, listened to proceedings through a hearing loop from the glass-walled dock as jury selection got under way on Wednesday.Judge Anthony Leonard QC asked potential jurors whether they or any family member or close friend had worked with Clifford or were connected to Operation Yewtree.He also warned them about being influenced by publicity of the case and told them not to search on the internet for any information relating to the case, saying: "You are not permitted to look on the internet for any information in relation to the case you are trying."A former EMI Records junior press officer, Clifford has acted as a powerful intermediary between the press and celebrities for more than five decades.
