The re-investigation into the murder of estate agent Suzy Lamplugh has been formally closed with detectives conceding there is nothing more they can do at this stage, it emerged yesterday.The decision was taken last week and follows a crown prosecution service ruling in October that there is not enough evidence to charge the prime suspect. Police could have sought fresh material against the 47-year-old man, but the current investigation - codenamed Phoebus - which was launched two years ago, was considered to have exhausted all the current leads. The suspect has been jailed for life for murder. At a press conference today Scotland Yard will say the inquiry is suspended until such time as new evidence emerges. Detectives hope to be joined by Miss Lamplugh's parents, Diana and Paul, who have never given up hope that the mystery of what happened to their 24-year-old daughter, who disappeared on July 28 1986, would be solved. Ms Lamplugh's body has never been found but she was officially declared dead in May 1993.
