Hundreds of officers yesterday began the largest search ever mounted by Nottinghamshire police as they combed woodland for two men wanted for the unconnected murders of a hairdresser and former miner.The two victims were killed within two weeks of each other and both suspects were last spotted within a few miles of the murder scenes. Robert Boyer, 42, has been missing since Keith Frogson was attacked and killed outside his home in Annesley Woodhouse on July 19, after a suspected row about the miners' strike of 1984. Eleven days later, Terry Rodgers, 55, vanished after his daughter, Chanel Taylor, 23, was shot dead at her home in Huthwaite. About 450 officers from eight police forces fanned out in Annesley Woods yesterday. Superintendent Stuart Wright of Nottinghamshire police said: "This is the biggest search with armed officers that we have ever carried out in this county. "We have no reason to believe [the suspects] have linked up. These are separate inquiries." Last week detectives said that the public had told them of more than 50 unconfirmed sightings of Mr Rodgers. They had also received numerous calls suggesting that Mr Boyer might be hiding in woodland. The body of Ms Taylor was discovered by her husband, seven weeks after their marriage. Mr Rodgers had moved in with the couple. He had been described as domineering towards his children. Mr Frogson, 62, was found dead on his doorstep after being attacked as he left a pub in his pit village. A crossbow was discovered nearby. The father of three was a veteran member of the National Union of Mineworkers and had been heavily involved in the 1984 strike. Police named Mr Boyer, who joined the rival Union of Democratic Mineworkers and worked during the strike, as a prime suspect.
