Gordon Brown today moved to deter public sector workers from considering industrial action over this year's pay deals in the wake of yesterday's wildcat strike by prison officers.The prime minister gave an uncompromising message to workers that the government would not countenance moving away from the "disciplined" pay awards which, he said, were the key to Britain's economic success over the past decade."We have succeeded in tackling inflation and having a stable economy because of the discipline of pay awards and that will continue," Mr Brown said. "Staging pay awards is an essential part of maintaining economic stability, and we will do nothing - nothing - to put that at risk."The chairman of the Prison Officers' Association (POA), Colin Moses, said Mr Brown had not mentioned recent awards in the private sector which have seen the average total pay of FTSE-100 chief executives rising to more than £2.8m.Mr Moses, who refused to rule out the possibility of further strikes as his members returned to work, said the 12-hour action had focused the minds of ministers.Asked on BBC News 24 whether the POA planned further industrial action as it continued to negotiate with the Ministry of Justice about a staged pay offer, Mr Moses said: "If I say that, I will end up in court."The government's decision to stage a 2.5% pay increase in two parts - a 1.5% rise in April followed by a 1% rise in October - is at the centre of the dispute and effectively cuts the award to 1.9%, the union has said.Since Labour came to power, the pay of POA members has fallen further behind that of police officers and been overtaken by that of nurses. A common complaint from striking officers yesterday was that their work went unrecognised in an increasingly stretched and under-resourced prison system.Prison officers said the maximum pay at London's Wormwood Scrubs was around £30,000. The starting salary for Metropolitan police officers once they have completed their training is more than £29,000.Earlier this year, Mr Brown imposed a pay freeze, or real-term cut, on nearly the entire public sector, except the military.Most public sector groups were told their pay offer would come in two stages, with 1.5% in April and the remainder delayed until autumn.Those groups included junior doctors (3%), dentists (2%), and nurses (2.5%), many of whom expected higher offers following more generous pay deals in recent years.According to the Office of National Statistics, average pay for many public sector industries grew by more than 5% a year for a large part of Labour's second term in office, when inflation was generally below 3%.POA leaders will meet the justice secretary, Jack Straw, tomorrow in a bid to break the deadlocked row.The government obtained a high court injunction yesterday ordering the 20,000 striking prison officers back to work. The union has a no-strike agreement, enshrined in law under the Conservative government in 1994.The POA has accused the Labour government of rescinding on a promise made before the 1997 general election to repeal the no-strike clause."When Gordon Brown puts his 81,000 prisoners in prison, he puts them into the hands of my members, who have to put up with eight assaults a day," Mr Moses said.The POA general secretary, Brian Caton, said prisoners in Leeds stood and applauded the staff returning to work, while inmates shook the hands of officers in Chelmsford, Essex.Mr Caton said the industrial action had forced the government to agree to hold new negotiations over pay, and deal with complaints about the level of assaults against staff and cuts in prisons budgets.He said two prison governors were attacked during the strike yesterday, which he regretted, but he pointed out that eight prison officers were now being assaulted every day - a huge increase on recent years.The POA does not expect to face any further legal action following yesterday's injunction. Officials said the injunction was never served on the union, and they made it clear the only reason the strike had been called off early was because of the promise of new talks."The strike was a reluctant success. It was entered into reluctantly, but we have got we wanted out of it which is talks with Jack Straw and senior prison service officials," Mr Caton said.He added that paying the 2.5% pay rise in full would be a "pittance".
