Detectives seeking a Manchester man after his wife and three children were found battered to death at their home revealed yesterday that he had flown to Thailand on July 29.Details were made public as the family of Rahan Arshad, 36, appealed to him to contact police.Officers discovered the bodies of Uzma Rahan, 32, her sons Adam, 11, and Abbas, eight, and daughter Henna, six, when they broke into their end of terrace home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, on Sunday evening.On Monday, police found Mr Arshad's BMW 320 sports car in a car park at terminal three at Heathrow.Detective Superintendent Martin Bottomley said yesterday that the three children had last been seen alive on July 28 at Bradshaw Hall, the Cheadle Hulme primary school they had attended since June.He said: "We are still very concerned for the safety of Mr Arshad but we do know he left this country via terminal three at Heathrow on July 29 and boarded a plane for Bangkok in Thailand. That was four weeks ago and he could be anywhere in the world by now. We are liaising with our colleagues in Thailand via Interpol with a view to tracing his movements. We are unaware of any contact he may have made with any family member since late July."Mr Arshad's brother Raswan was too distressed to read a prepared statement, which was later released by Greater Manchester police.It said: "Rahan, it's absolutely paramount that you come forward at this moment in time to assist the police with their inquiries. If not for yourself, do it for us, your father, sisters, and me. You should know how much we all love you and you should not feel as though you are alone."In another statement, Mrs Arshad's relatives said they had lost a very special family member.Police said that magistrates had given permission for a couple arrested in Burnage, four miles from Cheadle Hulme, on Wednesday to be held in custody for a further 32 hours.
