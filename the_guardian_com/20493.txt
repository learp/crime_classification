A man who stabbed a teenager in the neck with a broken vodka bottle on New Year's Day then kicked his head "like a football" was found guilty of murder today.Bradley Whitfield, 16, bled to death in the street after the attack in Leicester near his family home, in which he was also punched and hit with a metal bar.Darren Carr, 35, and a 16-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of murder at Nottingham Crown Court.Carr's 32-year-old girlfriend, Nicola Faulds, and a 16-year-old girl, were acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter.The trouble started as the four defendants were walking home after celebrating the New Year, the trial had been told, and one shouted abuse at Whitfield, his friends and brother.The row that ensued left the college student, a keen sportsman who had ambitions of becoming a PE teacher, with multiple injuries, including a fatal 2.5in deep puncture wound to his neck.The jury of six men and six women found Carr had delivered the lethal blow with a broken vodka bottle, but that his three co-defendants also took part in the attack.The defendants, who all denied murder, held hands as the jury announced its verdicts after more than nine hours of deliberations.Members of the packed public gallery cheered "yes" as the convictions were given, while Faulds and the two teenage defendants broke down in tears.Carr had told the court he lashed out in self-defence when he was set upon by the gang Whitfield was with, claiming he grabbed the still in-tact bottle from the ground.But the jury also heard that, hours after Whitfield bled to death, Carr walked into a police station and allegedly said: "I am scum. I have no excuse. I was drunk."I cannot bring the lad back. He was just a kid. I am going to do life. I am going to prison."One of the 16-year-olds suffered serious facial injuries, including a 12cm-long cut from lip to cheek, in the incident.After the verdicts were given, the court heard Carr had previous convictions for burglary, common assault and criminal damage, and was given an 18-month prison sentence in July 2006 for possession of cocaine with intent to supply.Sentencing was adjourned until next month.
