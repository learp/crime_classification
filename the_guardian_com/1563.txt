The number of people prosecuted for domestic violence increased by 11% last year and the number of those convicted of such crimes rose by 5%, a Home Office report revealed yesterday. Domestic violence accounts for one in six of all reported attacks, according to the annual report of the National Domestic Violence Delivery Plan. Repeat victimisation is an enormous factor in domestic violence, with more than one in four victims (27%) having been victimised at least three or for times.The Home Office minister, Alan Campbell, said the number of prosecutions nearly doubled in the past four years and an average 72% of cases now result in a successful prosecution. He said there were now 104 specialist domestic violence courts "providing victims across the country with the support they need to come forward and help us bring perpetrators to justice. But we know there is still more to be done, particularly in the area of prevention, by better identifying potential victims - working with police and victim support agencies." The Conservative party said the increase in prosecutions was "modest" and called for more to be done to tackle trafficking and forced prostitution. The shadow minister for women, Theresa May, said: "With one in four women experiencing domestic violence at some point in their lives, we need to do more to tackle the causes of violence, in order to prevent it occurring."
