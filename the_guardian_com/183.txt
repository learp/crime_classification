A 15-year-old boy in north Belfast has been knifed to death while walking to a garage to buy sweets.The murder has shocked Belfast, coming days after a 13-year-old boy was stabbed and a teenage girl was raped before her attackers stole her mobile phone to ring her mother with details.Police were last night questioning two men and a teenager over the murder of Thomas Devlin late on Wednesday.A talented musician who played the horn at school, he was walking along a leafy street with friends when two men jumped on him and stabbed him five times in the back. Police believe it was a random killing "without motive", and said they did not think it was sectarian.Thomas had spent the night playing computer games at his home in the Somerton area, an affluent part of north Belfast. One of his friends planned to stay over, and at around 11.30pm they decided to go out to buy sweets.On the way home, they were attacked. One of the other boys, aged 18, was also injured. A 16-year-old managed to escape. A local doctor tried to stem the bloodflow as Thomas lay dying.The boy's father, a broadcaster, and his mother, who works in industrial relations, said the family was in shock.His mother, Penny Holloway, said: "They all went down to the Esso Garage at Fortwilliam to get sweets and crisps and Coke. These guys were obviously following them. They were jumped from behind and stabbed in the back."Thomas was stabbed five times and they intended to kill him. It has come to something when a boy can't even walk up the street to his own home."Alban Maginness, of the moderate nationalist SDLP, said: "Leaving aside sectarian and paramilitary activity, there has been an increase in violence. Coming so soon after the rape, it paints an awful picture of the city."Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly said he felt that the attack bore "the hallmarks of a sectarian attack" and urged people in north Belfast to be vigilant.
