The director of public prosecution's call to allow cameras into the courtroom is to be welcomed if it will have the effect of re-engaging the public in the judicial process.Open justice should not mean that the media are allowed into court but have one hand tied behind their backs, able to report words, but not images.And as Gavin Millar pointed out earlier this week, it is odd that we can see on TV our MPs debating court cases, but we can see no footage of the cases themselves.However, those rushing to welcome Keir Starmer's words – and Sky has been very vocal in pushing the case for greater openness – should just pause to contemplate the challenge they face if this is allowed.While the OJ Simpson trial has been cited as an example of the over-dramatisation of TV court coverage, one can find much less drama closer to home.The experiment in Scotland of allowing cameras into court amply demonstrated the judicial system's capacity for extreme dullness.Any court reporter who has sat on the press bench waiting for a trial to go ahead will tell you that court reporting can often be long periods of boredom, interspersed with periods of high excitement. The court reporter distills out the boredom and presents just the drama. For TV to do the same will require editing of heroic speed and proportion.There is little doubt that there is a need for better and more comprehensive coverage of the courts. The regional media, for whom it was once one of the three Cs that filled their pages – court, crime and council – have pulled out of the courts, leaving a vacuum in coverage. They often cite changes in reader demands, but one suspects it has more to do with cuts in staff and expenditure that regional news groups have been making in recent years, than a genuine lack of public interest in court proceedings.While Starmer says that most solicitors are in favour of the move, I wonder if so many in the court system itself will be so enthusiastic.When a couple of years ago I was one of the very few journalists at a debate on opening up the family courts (Joshua Rozenberg, Bob Satchwell of the Society of Editors and Radio 4's Sanchia Berg were the only others) the lawyers, social workers and judges were queuing up to accuse the media of sensationalism. We were, they said, not interested in the day-to-day, we would only be there for the high-profile cases.The fact is they were probably right.The broadcasters will not provide the level of coverage that the regional newspapers once did. They simply do not have the resources to staff and then edit footage from all the crown courts and magistrates courts in the country, never mind the civil courts.They will not cover the 90%-plus of criminal business dealt with by magistrates courts; the legions of petty acquisitive criminals motivated by a need to buy drugs.They will cherry-pick the big cases, just as they always have done.This is not an argument not to allow the cameras in. It is not claimed that local newspapers produced perfect comprehensive coverage of the courts – but some of them got close. Some regional papers gave, and still give, a very good idea of just what goes on in the judicial system.Allowing in TV cameras will no doubt make some of the higher courts more open in some of the most newsworthy cases. Whether it gives viewers an accurate view of the judicial system in action is another matter entirely.
