A future Harold Shipman would be able to kill patients and escape detection under government plans to reform coroners courts and the death certification system, the senior judge who chaired the inquiry into the GP's murders told MPs last night.The constitutional affairs minister, Harriet Harman, said on Monday that proposals to update the coroner system had drawn on an inquiry by Dame Janet Smith into the serial killer, which concluded he had murdered 215 patients over 23 years.But she said the government was "not persuaded" that all deaths in England and Wales needed to be reported to the coroner, a key plank of the inquiry's proposals. Bereaved families could ask the coroner for a second opinion on the cause of death if they were suspicious.Dame Janet told the commons constitutional affairs committee that "too much" of the death certification process was left to individual doctors. The reforms did not address that problem, she said."If these reforms go through there could still be a Shipman out there, still killing patients, still certifying their deaths ... Nothing will have changed."
