Two film producers have been jailed for their part in an “audacious” £2.2m tax scam “motivated by the pure greed of wealthy individuals”, according to HM Revenue and Customs.Christopher Walsh Atkins, 40, and Christina Slater, 37, submitted vastly inflated invoices to take advantage of tax breaks on two independent UK projects.The pair falsely claimed to have spent £5.7m and made significant losses on Starsuckers, a documentary condemning the press, and Mercedes the Movie, HMRC said. This apparently allowed wealthy investors to falsely claim around £40,000 tax relief for every £20,000 invested.Chris Atkins, of Camden, north London, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and Slater, of Leamington Spa, was jailed for four years at Southwark crown court on Friday.They were also banned from being a company official for 12 years after previously being convicted of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue, theft and fraud.Jennie Granger, of HMRC, said: “This was an audacious attempt to defraud HMRC and was motivated by the pure greed of dishonest and wealthy individuals. The majority of those involved in this fraud had no interest in the film industry, or regard for the impact of their criminality on honest taxpayers.“After painstaking and complex work from our investigators, and a series of long trials, HMRC has dismantled the fraudulent operation. The long sentences handed down send a powerful message to those tempted to deceive HMRC. Nobody is beyond our reach.”Accountant Terence Potter, 56, a former partner with Ernst and Young, devised and promoted the schemes, produced false documents and submitted fraudulent tax avoidance schemes. He was jailed for eight years in December last year for four counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.He was assisted by independent financial adviser Neil Williams-Denton, 42, who also promoted the schemes to high-earning investment bankers. He was jailed for six years for two charges of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.Three investment bankers, Phillip Jenkins, 51, James Hyde, 43, and Hamish MacLellan 43, were each jailed for four years and six months in September last year for conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.
