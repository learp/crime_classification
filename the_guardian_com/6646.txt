Muggers and burglars will be forcibly tested for traces of illegal drugs and sent into rehab under new powers introduced this week to tackle the link between drugs and crime.Suspects arrested for so-called acquisitive crime - even though they may they later prove innocent -- will be automatically swabbed for traces of cocaine, crack or heroin in their bodies in an effort to identify those who are stealing to fund a drug habit. They will then be assessed by counsellors, and those considered to be addicted will be offered rehab treatment.Refusing to be tested will be punishable with a fine or jail sentence, while declining to comply with the assessment means offenders risk being denied bail. People who turn out to be innocent who have tested positive for drugs, will still be offered rehab treatment if their habits are considered to be serious.Until now, only people who have been charged have been tested for drugs. Moving the tests earlier in the process raises the likelihood that innocent people mistakenly arrested will be swabbed, and their habits detected.The tests will be piloted first in high-crime areas at greatest risk from muggings and burglaries, and are designed to tackle persistent offenders whose repeated crimes are driven by their addiction.Drug-related crime is estimated to cost Britain around £16 billion a year. A heroin user spends on average £50 a day maintaining their habit, while a prolific crack user can spend hundreds of pounds a day on the drug, making crime the obvious route to pay for it.
