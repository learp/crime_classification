Game of Thrones actor and former Casualty star Clive Mantle has had part of his ear bitten off after asking neighbouring hotel guests to keep the noise down, his agent said. Mantle was reportedly staying at a Travelodge in Newcastle when he asked people in the room next door to quieten down. His request triggered an attack resulting in the loss of the top of of his right ear, which was later found and reattached by doctors, said a spokesman for Sarahband Associates.
