Violent crime recorded by police increased by 9% in the three months from April to June this year, figures released by the Home Office today revealed.The figures included a 12% rise in violence against the person, with a 7% jump in more serious offences.Gun crime rose by 3% in the 12 months to April, compared with a 35% increase in 2001-2002, provisional figures showed.The figures suggest that the growth in firearms offences has begun to decelerate, but they follow shocking recent stories of gun violence. Seven-year-old Toni-Ann Byfield was shot in the back in north London, and Marian Bates, 64, was shot and killed during a robbery at her jeweller's shop in Nottingham.Separate British Crime Survey (BCS) figures, from a more authoritative study asking people about their experience of offences, show a 5% fall in violent crime to around 2.7m incidents in the 12 months to June.However, the Home Office said that the change was not statistically significant.Violent crime, however, rose in the police-recorded figures, from 245,100 incidents during January to March this year to 272,900 in the second quarter. The total includes 233,200 offences of violence against the person. Of these, 10,300 were classed as "more serious", and included homicides, conspiracy to murder and serious wounding.The number of sex offences reported to police rose by 5%, to 12,800, during April to June, compared with the same period last year.A Home Office spokesman said that much of the rise in recorded violent crime was due to better reporting and recording by police of "low-level thuggery", along with a growing willingness by victims of sexual assaults to go to police.Criminal damage rose to 300,700 incidents, compared with 289,900 in the previous three months, but recorded robberies fell by an estimated 7%, to 26,900 incidents.According to the BCS, vehicle theft in the year until June fell by 7% to 2.3m incidents, while vehicle crime as a whole dropped by 6% period-on-period, according to police-recorded data for the second quarter of this year.The Home Office minister, Hazel Blears, said: "The increase in serious violence is an area of concern, and I'm encouraged by more intensive policing and the impact of new measures to tackle gun crime."Crime overall is continuing to fall, and offences such as burglary, robbery and vehicle crime - crimes which concern people the most - are showing significant falls."Measures to combat anti-social behaviour, street crime and schemes to cut drug-related crime are making an impact and contributing to keeping these crimes at a low level."
