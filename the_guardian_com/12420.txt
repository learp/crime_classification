I am a teenager and have experienced at first hand the problems which have caused the surge in juvenile muggings and robberies (What really causes crime, July 12). The initial problem is boredom. Many teenagers want to escape their parents and see friends. But in the evenings, there are very few places to go. Shopping centres may suffice in the day, but they close. Pubs and bars are out of the question. Stuffy organisations like the Scouts are no fun.So British youth end up turning to streets and commons for much needed freedom. And this is the second problem. Kids are vulnerable on the streets. They are a prize to be had, with little risk to the offender. The surge in ownership of compact technology - mobile phones, portable stereos and the like - means that street urchins have become street oysters: a threat of petty violence, and the pearl is harvested. You cannot police every street. An odd conviction will not stamp out this forest fire. There is a whole society of juvenile muggers. They were also bored, and got in with the wrong crowds. Drugs follow, and the temptation for mugging is all too much. Some even see it as a game. So what is the solution? Get children off the streets. We need much more state funding for youth clubs, safe places where teenagers can be free from their parents and develop interests: music, art, sport, photography, skate boarding, DJing. There are many things the youth of today could be doing. The successful youth clubs that do exist are doing wonders for the community, but they are simply far too rare. Education is not all about exam results, Mr Blair. Give every town a brilliant youth club, and you will be well on your way to combating street crime.
