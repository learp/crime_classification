The parents of the five men suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence broke their silence for the first time yesterday by declaring their sons were innocent and had been "crucified and tried by the media". In a letter issued through their solicitor, the relatives said allegations against their sons were "unfounded". "We, the parents of these innocent young men and children at the time are sick of them being victimised for a political cause and crucified and tried by the media. "Most people have prejudged this case because of the adverse publicity, we would ask that they look at this case with an open mind." Stephen Lawrence, aged 18, was stabbed to death in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993, by a white gang who screamed racist abuse before murdering him. The Old Bailey trial of Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson collapsed in April 1996. The cases against David Norris and Jamie Acourt were dropped before they reached court. The letter, sent to London Weekend Television, was prompted by an investigation into the background of the five men due to be screened on Friday. The documentary, called The Lawrence Five: Their Violent Past, includes interviews with alleged victims of the men who speak about the racism and violent assaults they have suffered. The programme also reveals previously unseen sections of police surveillance video of the men. The letter continued: "The [surveillance] video was a product of what happened to our sons, they are hitting back after 18 months of persecution. We would not justify your unfounded allegations by answering them all individually, but would like to stress that our sons are completely INNOCENT of any violent offence, including the murder of Stephen Lawrence. As you are putting so many views forward, we hope our letter can be brought to the public's attention."
