It is disappointing that the government has chosen to ignore the legitimate rights and aspirations of sex workers by ignoring our calls that our human rights be recognised. It is our choice to become sex workers whether we are male, female or transgender. The government's proposals to criminalise our clients if we are controlled for gain will effectively deny the vast majority of us our right to earn our living as we see fit.Most British subjects are, in one form or another, controlled for gain, but apparently a sex worker's consent to work through the agency of another is to be illegal and worse, clients are to be expected to know the personal working arrangements of the sex worker he/she/they are visiting. Sex workers for good legitimate reasons choose to work through agencies or brothels. These agents offer sex workers security, anonymity and general companionship. It would be considered an abuse of our human rights if the government were to force every worker in the land to work alone and without contact with fellow workers and it would be in contravention of the charter of human rights article 23.The idea of criminalising consensual sex between adults is a retrograde step. What is particularly sad is that the very people whom the government claim that they wish to help by enacting these draconian laws are the very people who will suffer most. The very people best placed to inform on abuse either because of trafficking or coercion are the very people who will be criminalised, the clients and the managements of sex workers.This is a missed opportunity. The government could have chosen to follow the example of New Zealand and recognised the rights of sex workers and allowed sex workers to create safe areas to work and to negotiate working conditions without fear of reprisal by the state.
