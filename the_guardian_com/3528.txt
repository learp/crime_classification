Homeowners would be allowed to shoot burglars under a new bill unveiled by a Tory backbencher today.The bill drawn up by Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, would give householders the right to use "any act" to defend themselves or their property from intruders.It would mean actions such as those of Norfolk farmer Tony Martin - who shot dead a teenage burglar - would be legal.But the private member's bill is highly unlikely to receive parliamentary support.A similar bid topped a BBC Radio 4 poll on the private member's bill people would most like to see become law.Labour MP Stephen Pound had promised to champion the winning bill. But he pulled out, saying it was unworkable and endorsed "the slaughter of 16-year-old kids".The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, also said such a bid would be denied parliamentary time as it would introduce "vigilante law". Mr Gale said the government needed to address growing public concern over the imbalance in the criminal law. "Whether we like it or not there is a clear public perception that the law has tilted too far in favour of the intruder as the victim and against the real victim, the householder," he said. "Inevitably this must mean that the innocent have to think twice before taking any action that, while intended to protect themselves, their families or their properties, might lead them to themselves face charges in court." He conceded the bill would be seen by some as "draconian". But he added: "I hope that those who might seek to oppose this measure will consider very carefully the weight of public opinion that will be behind it and allow it a fair wind."
