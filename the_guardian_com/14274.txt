Police have arrested a man on suspicion of causing the death by dangerous driving of a six-year-old schoolboy who was left at the roadside after being knocked down.Detectives in West Yorkshire said that a 21-year-old man from Huddersfield would be questioned about the events, which happened in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Saturday. The driver is said to have stopped out of sight of the accident and inspected the front of his car for damage.The child, Owen Wightman, was playing in the street close to his home. The boy was crossing a busy road with a seven-year-old friend when he was struck by a light blue or grey hatchback driven by a single man who appeared to be in his 20s.Detectives have had a good response to appeals for witnesses after it emerged that the car pulled in for the damage check, in a side road about 100 yards further on.CCTV footage from a passing bus with details of the car has also been analysed. Wightman's parents, Joanne, 33, and Neil, 31, appealed before the arrest for someone to come forward. They said: "Owen was a perfect little man who was taken from us - just perfect in every way. He walked into a room and lit it up. He was our bundle of joy and our little ray of sunshine."Passers-by continued to add to a pile of flowers and teddy bears at the scene, in memory of Owen, who had two brothers, Jack, 12, and one-year-old Thomas.Jack's tribute alongside a green cuddly monkey, read: "You were the best bro' ever. Even when we used to fight and argue I still loved you anyway." Another message said: "To mummy and daddy's little soldier, forever in our hearts, love u always."Rewards for information resulting in a conviction total £15,000 – two-thirds from the Sun newspaper and the balance from the charity Crimestoppers.
