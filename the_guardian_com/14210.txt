The teenager Shafilea Ahmed, whose body was found on the banks of a river, was unlawfully killed, a coroner ruled today.The 17-year-old, who claimed she was under pressure from her parents to agree to an arranged marriage, went missing from her home in September 2003.Five months later, her badly decomposed body was discovered by the River Kent at Sedgwick, Cumbria.Police launched a murder inquiry and arrested her parents on suspicion of kidnapping the Warrington teenager, but both were released without charge.Ian Smith, the coroner for east and south Cumbria, told the inquest: "Shafilea was the victim of a very vile murder."I'm convinced of that because of the way in which the body was disposed, it had been hidden and she had been taken many miles away from home."I do not know who did it. There's no evidence before the court as to who did it."I sincerely hope in the future, inquiries will be carried out by the police and they will one day discover who did it because this young woman has not had justice."Delivering his verdict at the end of the four-day inquest in Kendal, Smith said he believed Shafilea had died within a few hours of leaving work on the night of September 11 2003.He could not state where she died but said he was "very confident" it was not on the river bank."I do not believe she escaped and ran away. She was taken," he added.Smith said he believed the concept of an arranged marriage was "central" to the circumstances leading up to the tragedy.Shafilea had become a "frightened young woman" following a phone conversation in 2002 between her father, Iftikhar, and his uncle.They had discussed a possible arranged marriage between Shafilea and the uncle's son.Her father told the hearing that such an arrangement needed the consent of the boy and girl but the coroner said he believed the "greater family" had more say on the issue and could impose pressure for it go ahead.He said: "She [Shafilea] did not want to be married, full stop, at this point. She did not want to marry someone she did not know or may not like."She wanted to forge ahead with a career, she did not want to stop her studies and she did not want to live abroad. Rightly or wrongly, she feared all these things might happen."Shafilea saw a planned family trip to Pakistan in February 2003, in which she feared she would be married off by her parents, as a threat to her future and the end of her freedom, Smith said."Her ambition was to live her own life in her own way. To study, to follow a career in the law and to do what she wanted to do," he said.Despite hearing a great deal of evidence from friends and teachers during the inquest at County Hall, authorities remain unclear as to how the youngster died.Ruling the cause of death as "unascertained", Smith said he was satisfied she did not die of natural causes or suicide.A pathologist, Dr Alison Armour, told the hearing the most likely cause was by smothering or strangling.Smith said there was nothing to support such conjecture and it could only be treated as speculation.Investigating officer Superintendent Geraint Jones, of Cheshire police, said: "We offer our condolences to everyone who knew and cared for Shafilea."Any death is tragic, but Shafilea's unnecessary and cruel death is particularly sad. This remains a live murder inquiry."
