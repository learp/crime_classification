An investigation has been launched into how a violent criminal was able to boast about his crimes on Facebook while in prison.Kane Barratt, who is serving an indeterminate sentence for robbery, was able to update his web page on the social networking site using an illicit mobile phone in Lancaster prison.Barratt, 21, from Stockport, was part of a gang jailed last month after leading a violent crime spree across Greater Manchester.Barratt published photographs of himself in his cell and asked the apparently rhetorical question: "Who should I put on my hit list today?"The prisoner, who called himself Kane Reilly online, posted a series of messages about his sentencing. One said: "They can put me behind my door but they can't stop time."Barratt also completed a quiz on Stockport, had his fortune told and took an IQ test.He was able to communicate with friends who were in trouble with the police. Some of the updates were made using a mobile phone and others appeared to have been through a computer.Barratt was sentenced last month to a minimum of five and a half years. He admitted two robberies and three burglaries, claiming they were to pay off an underworld debt, Manchester crown court heard.In one burglary a man had acid sprayed in his face before an Audi A4 was stolen. Detectives later found Barratt posing in the car on a picture taken with a disposable camera. In another attack he threatened a couple with a machete as he stole their car.One of his victims said he was "absolutely appalled" that Barratt had been able to get on to the web. "I just can't believe he's not been checked or searched. He'll probably come away from this with all his mates thinking he's some kind of hero."Prisoners are banned from mobile phones and the internet.A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said it was investigating. "Prisoners do not have access to mobile phones or the internet, and cannot personally contribute to websites."This form of media is totally unregulated and we have no power to remove a social networking profile from the internet."The ministry has asked Facebook to remove the profile.
