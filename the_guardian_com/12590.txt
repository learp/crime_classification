Government plans to punish anti-social behaviour by docking housing benefit are criticised by the Local Government Association today as discriminatory.It says the government is making "the worst kind of knee jerk reaction to a complex problem" by singling out low-income tenants when it has no plans to clamp down on offenders who do not receive welfare payments.Responding to a Department of Work and Pensions consultation paper on rights and responsibilities, the LGA says that owner occupiers can be just as guilty. "This is an insult to the vast majority of tenants, and I'd like to see the evidence which indicates that housing benefit claimants behave in a worse manner than anyone else," said Richard Kemp, the Liverpool councillor who chairs the LGA's housing executive.The consultation paper asked whether housing benefit should be docked if someone is found guilty of an anti-social offence, or if a local council receives a complaint."There is something specifically wrong about someone being able to make the life of their neighbour hellish and doing it courtesy of a subsidy from the taxpayer," the housing minister, Malcom Wicks, said. He is considering whether to introduce a national scheme or confine new powers to particularly difficult neighbourhoods. Peter Hetherington
