A teenage boy has died after being stabbed in an east London street. The 17-year-old, who has not been named, was found shortly before midnight on Thursday.Detectives said that two 16-year-olds had been arrested in connection with the death, which they said was not thought to be gang-related.Officers were called to Chesterford Road, Newham, at 11.40pm on Thursday. Yesterday a police spokesman said that they were still trying to trace the family of the victim, who was pronounced dead at the scene."Inquiries continue to establish the circumstances that led to the incident but at this early stage we do not believe the murder to be gang-related."The murder comes at a time of heightened concern about violent crime across the country. Last week 11-year-old Rhys Jones was shot dead in Liverpool, and several teenagers have been killed in London in the past year.In the past week Labour and the Tories have clashed over statistics on violent crime. The Home Office criticised press reports that claimed robberies at knifepoint had doubled in three years. Conservative leader David Cameron claimed there was "anarchy" on the UK's streets, and highlighted high-profile gun and knife crimes as part of his attack on the government over social breakdown.Yesterday Ken Jones, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, called for political leaders to be more "calm, measured and objective" in public statements about crime.
