Britain is getting safer (Crime rate falls 7%, 23 April). It might not always seem like it when you read the papers, but our efforts in combating crime are working. But we also know that fighting crime is a process, not an event. There will never be a day when we abolish all crime, and for that reason we must keep up the effort if we're to stop it from mushrooming as it did in the past. A key part of the progress we have made has been the creation of police community support officers. There are now more than 16,000 of us, a role only created in the last decade – and reinforced two years ago when neighbourhood policing teams went national. The success of PCSOs – supporting the police to reassure the public – deserves to be supported by all parties. However, the Conservative party has refused to protect our efforts or those of the police, putting us on the frontline of potential cuts when we should be concentrating on the frontline of crime. Cutting PCSOs will put the public at risk and could increase crime and fear of crime. We urge the Conservatives to rethink.Ken Beck, Paul Jackson, Jill Harrison, Nicola Greenfield, Chris Wright, and 325 other police community support officers
