The chief constable of Greater Manchester has issued a highly unusual personal plea to a runaway prisoner who was accidentally released from jail.Bobby Phipps, 22, was freed from Manchester prison, where he was awaiting trial on six attempted murder charges. Yesterday, Michael Todd promised Mr Phipps he would not be harmed if he ended his flight. "He can hand himself in to me personally, if necessary," Mr Todd said. "He knew he wasn't supposed to be released at that time. Given that, the circumstances of this situation must seem very suspicious and it may be that he suspects some kind of 'set-up' by the authorities. "I personally guarantee his safety, if he voluntarily hands himself into my officers." Mr Phipps appeared before magistrates court on November 12 in connection with the charges. But three days later, he was released in error by prison staff. An inquiry into the release has been ordered by the Prison Service. Police have said Mr Phipps is a danger to the public. Anyone with information is urged to call 0161 856 6430.
