One of Britain's most outspoken senior police officers resigned last night in the wake of allegations of financial irregularities. It also emerged he had been under scrutiny over allegations of misuse of the police computer.The chief constable of Dyfed-Powys, Terry Grange, who has often criticised the government's approach to legislation, retired with immediate effect after it was confirmed that he was under investigation. The local police authority accepted his resignation "with regret" last night."Mr Grange had indicated that he had allowed his private life to interfere with his professional role as chief constable," said a statement. "This has led the police authority to consider the chief constable's position and it was considered to be appropriate to accept his retirement."The surprise resignation followed an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into allegations of misuse of the police computer system and alleged financial irregularities. "Although the chief constable has now retired, the IPCC is continuing its independent investigation into alleged financial irregularities," the commission said in a statement. "It would be inappropriate for the IPCC to comment further at this stage."A well-placed source in the inquiry said that the allegations of misuse of the police computer were not criminal in nature and the IPCC would not pursue it now that Grange was no longer a serving officer. The allegations surfaced last week and were made public but the officer was not named.The source said the allegations of financial irregularities related to Grange's professional life, despite the police authority's claim that he "had indicated that he had allowed his private life to interfere with his professional role".The investigation has been going on only for a matter of days.The Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik, whose Montgomeryshire constituency is in the Dyfed-Powys area, said last night he was "gobsmacked"."Whatever the reason for Terry Grange's departure, it must not be allowed to affect the quality of service provision we get from Dyfed-Powys police," he said. "Whatever has happened, at a human level I wish Terry the best for the future ... Terry Grange has been very proactive at involving parliamentarians and talking to us about funding settlements."Grange, a former member of the Parachute Regiment who joined the Metropolitan police in 1971, was the spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers on child protection.In that role he came under fire last year for suggesting that teenage boys who had sex with girls between 13 and 15 should not be regarded as paedophiles.His remarks were widely misinterpreted and misquoted.
