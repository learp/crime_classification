Tent thieves, it is time to tremble! No longer will British music festivals sit idly by as you nick tent poles, nab canvases or whisk lean-tos back to your lairs. The newly formed Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) has announced its first initiative â€“ a security taskforce that will target tent thefts and campsite crime at the country's music shindigs.Jim King, a board member at the AIF, talked the tough talk in a statement. "Whilst still statistically low, thefts at UK festivals have to be addressed," he said. "Customer experience and safety is a most important part of the whole festival experience and we want to act to ensure that customers have a great time at our events without experiencing the upsetting scenario of being a victim of crime."Though we would argue that music, not tents, is the most important aspect of the "festival experience", we applaud the AIF's attention to this problem. The taskforce will work with event security and police services throughout the UK to identify known thieves before they enter festival sites, as well as helping festival organisers to share intelligence about vile tent-thieving gangs.Bestival promoter Rob da Bank praised the scheme, calling it a, er, tent pole of the whole AIF organisation. "Any theft at all is really upsetting for the promoter and the people involved," he said. "This was one of the main reasons I wanted to set up AIF and I really believe we can make a difference with this initiative."Organisers intend to launch the taskforce by March 2009.
