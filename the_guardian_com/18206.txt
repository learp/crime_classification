A woman accused of breaking into Simon Cowell's Holland Park home wielding a broken brick has been remanded in custody at West London magistrates court.Cowell was watching TV in his bedroom when he heard a "loud bang" coming from his bathroom, prosecutors claim.Leanne Zaloumis, 29, was taken to Notting Hill police station after being found in Cowell's mansion, the charge says.The 52-year-old X Factor judge called his staff and was taken back to his bedroom during the incident at around 10.30pm on Saturday.The charge against Zaloumis, read out in court, said she intended to "inflict grievous bodily harm upon a person therein and at the time of committing the said burglary had with you a weapon of offence, namely a broken house brick".Zaloumis will appear again at Isleworth crown court on 12 June, district judge James Henderson said.The defendant, who appeared in the dock with unkempt hair and a baggy grey sweatshirt, stared downwards and showed no emotion during the eight-minute hearing.Cowell was not in the packed public and press gallery in court.
