A man was charged today with the murder of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common in July 1992, the Crown Prosecution Service said.Robert Napper, 41, will appear at City of Westminster magistrates' court on December 4.The move follows a review of the notorious murder of the former model and lifeguard while she walked with her young son on July 15 1992.Scotland Yard said: "Robert Napper, 41, has today been charged with the murder of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common on July 15 1992."He will appear before City of Westminster magistrates' court on December 4 at 10.30am."Nickell, 23, was stabbed 49 times and sexually assaulted in a frenzied attack that led to one of the largest murder inquiries ever seen in the UK. Her two-year-old son, Alex, was found clinging to her, covered in his mother's blood.Hilary Bradfield, of the Crown Prosecution Service's serious casework unit, said the charge against Napper followed a "painstaking" review of the murder inquiry, which "considered all aspects of the case in detail".She said: "This week we have reached a decision that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and have authorised the police to charge [Robert Napper]."A total of 32 men were questioned in connection with the murder. Police eventually targeted an unemployed man from Roehampton, south London, called Colin Stagg who was known to walk his dog on the common.While there was no forensic evidence linking Stagg to the scene, attention soon focused exclusively on him and police attempted to obtain evidence against him through a complex sting operation involving an undercover policewoman.The case against Stagg was thrown out when it came to the Old Bailey in 1994 on the grounds that police had used a "honeytrap" plot to encourage him to confess. Police subsequently re-opened their inquiry.Last year John Reid, then home secretary, agreed that Stagg should receive compensation. Legal experts say he could get £250,000-£500,000.Scotland Yard launched a new inquiry into Nickell's murder after the collapse of Stagg's trial.
