A London council has promised to pay the university tuition fees of some of its poorest teenagers in what is the first scheme of its kind in the country.Southwark council in south London said the cost of going to university was now so high, it was a "significant deterrent" to pupils and parents in the area.It is calling on local school-leavers whose family income is £21,000 or less, and who have top grades and a history of voluntary work, to apply to have their fees paid from its scholarship fund.The council has put £50,000 into the fund for students starting university this autumn, double that amount for next year and £150,000 for the year after.In Southwark, the average family income is approximately £17,000. A poll published last week showed undergraduates who have already started their degrees expect to graduate with more than £24,000 of debt.From 2012, tuition fees at English universities will rise from £3,375 per year of study to up to £9,000. Students pay the fees once they graduate and earn at least £21,000 a year. While some future graduates will be better off under the new system, many others will be saddled with considerably more debt.Catherine McDonald, Southwark's cabinet member for children's services, said the hike in tuition fees and the removal of a weekly payment for 16- to 18-year-olds from poor families to encourage them to stay in education – the education maintenance allowance – would leave "whole swaths of young people either burdened with huge debts" or likely to miss out on university."We want everyone who wants to stay on in education to get a foot on the jobs ladder – regardless of their financial situation," she said. "With record youth unemployment, we believe that investing in young people's skills and future job prospects is the best way to help improve the health of the nation's economy."One of the areas worst affected by last week's riots was Peckham, which is in Southwark. Youths looted shops, stolen fireworks were thrown at lines of riot police and a bus was set alight near Peckham fire station.Peter John, leader of Southwark council, said this made it "more important than ever" for the local authority to support young people "so they can reach their full potential and secure a better future for themselves"."The vast majority had nothing to do with the criminal behaviour that took place on our streets and we want to recognise the great contribution that many of them make to their local communities," he said.The council said pupils would need their headteacher to support their application and a panel of education experts will assess each applicant.
