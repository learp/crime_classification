One of the foreign prisoners released without being considered for deportation has since been convicted of murder, it was revealed yesterday. The disclosure came in a letter from Lin Homer, the director general of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, which also revealed that only 46 of the 1,019 foreign prisoners involved in the crisis have been deported.But officials stressed that because the convicted murderer had been in Britain more than 30 years he could not have been deported under current immigration rules. The foreign prisoner scandal cost the last home secretary, Charles Clarke, his job and has contributed to the turbulent start to John Reid's tenure.So far deportation proceedings have started in 705 of the 1,019 cases and a decision has been taken not to pursue a further 215. The rest are still being assessed. In 239 cases the released prisoner is now in detention pending deportation, with 55 on bail.Ms Homer said only 46 deportations had taken place so far because of the complexity of the removal process. She said it took around six months to carry out a removal. Deportations would increase as internal processes were accelerated.The released foreign prisoner who has since been given a life sentence for murder is a Commonwealth and Irish citizen. Mr Reid has asked for a review of the immigration rule that blocks his deportation.
