A police computer expert today described how he found graphic child pornography videos on a laptop recovered from the home of the Bafta-winning comedy actor Chris Langham.Christopher Crute, a forensic computer analyst for Kent police, said file names made reference to children as young as seven, and some included the words Lolita, incest, rape, whore and hussy.Mr Crute also told the jury at Maidstone crown court the initials PTHC on some of the files stood for "pre-teen hardcore".The files had been downloaded from the internet to an Apple laptop computer on November 28 2005 at around 11pm, Mr Crute told the court.Mr Langham, 58, is accused of 10 counts of indecent assault and two of buggery between January 1996 and April 2000. He also faces 15 charges of downloading child pornography from the internet. He denies all the allegations.The court has heard that his alleged victim, who is now 25 years old, claims Mr Langham took her virginity in a London hotel room when she was 14.The pair met while Mr Langham was performing in Les Misérables in London's West End in the role of Thénardier. The prosecution alleges he began a three-year campaign of "systematic abuse" by planting a kiss on her lips during an acting lesson in his dressing room.Mr Langham's laptop was recovered, along with a desktop computer and an external disk drive, at his home in Golford, near Cranbrook, Kent.Mr Crute said he found a password stored in an email on the computer for an explicit website. He also told the jury he had found files containing scripts for the BBC drama Help, which starred Mr Langham. Before jurors heard about the downloaded material, Judge Philip Statman warned them: "It is vital that when you look at that which you are about to see, which you will find graphic, you take a cool, calm and dispassionate view of this evidence."But at one point the judge had to ask Richard Barraclough QC, prosecuting, to stop reading the material because it was "very distressing". Mr Langham's alleged victim earlier told the jury he claimed that looking at child pornography on the internet made him feel he was "a better man" than the adults who appeared in it.His defence counsel, David Whitehouse QC, said his client had downloaded the images for research purposes while writing Help.In one of the episodes that Mr Langham wrote, his character, a psychiatrist, interviewed a paedophile.The comedy star Paul Whitehouse, who appeared with Mr Langham in Help, is expected to give evidence. He played several patients being treated by Mr Langham's character.The hearing continues.
