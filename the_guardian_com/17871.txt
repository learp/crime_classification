Perceptions of shoplifting as a mainly female crime, characterised by petty pilfering or teenage bravado, are out of step with a far more organised reality, according to a survey of retail crime.The study reveals that significantly more men than women are jailed for shoplifting and thefts by staff, and that the offenders are predominantly older, more organised and frequently steal higher-value goods to order. The research by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) at Nottingham University also shows that theft by staff, unlike shoplifting, is on the increase in the UK. While staff theft accounts for far fewer losses than theft by shoppers, the sums stolen per offence are higher, averaging £816 for women and £919 for men.Here, though, the gender picture is different: while more men are caught stealing more, the more prolific female offenders - those stealing more than £10,000 - stole over 40% more than their male counterparts. In some cases, staff are placed in shops by gangs who then take the goods or cash stolen. Joshua Bamfield of the CRR, author of the report and of the European Retail Theft Barometer, said that, while female-dominated shoplifting was a myth, the idea of "professional male criminals and female amateurs" was also inaccurate. "The picture is a highly complex one," he said. The gender analysis revealed that women were most likely to shoplift cosmetics, perfume, clothes, babywear and groceries, while men took hairdryers, electrical toothbrushes and power tools.
