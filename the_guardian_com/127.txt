Crime in England and Wales fell by 9% last year to its lowest level since comparable records began in 1981, according to official figures published today.The results of the 2010 British Crime Survey, which has estimated crime levels based on the experience of 45,000 households since 1981, showed it dipped below 10m offences.The continuing fall in crime in the 12 months to April this year, from a peak in 1995, is confirmed by figures showing crimes recorded by the police, which fell by 8% to 4.3m.The statistics show that crime has fallen by 43% since 1997, leaving Labour able to claim that its level is lower now than when Tony Blair first entered Downing Street.The Conservatives, who put claims of rising crime at the centre of their Broken Britain pre-election campaign, acknowledged that crime had been falling."Any reductions in crime are welcome, but we know these statistics offer a partial picture about the true level of crime," said the home secretary, Theresa May. "And there are many offences, including antisocial behaviour, which are not always reported or fully recorded, but which ruin too many lives."Nobody should accept a situation where at least 26,000 people fall victim to crime every day."But the shadow home secretary, Alan Johnson, said: "We now have the bizarre spectacle of Tory ministers trashing the official figures, which show undeniably that crime has fallen."The political sensitivity of the figures was highlighted by the publication of a survey in Police Review magazine, conducted by a former chief constable, which estimated that as many 60,000 police officers and staff could lose their jobs in public sector cuts.The home secretary dismissed this prediction today as "highly speculative" and pointed out that not all savings would come from staff costs.David Blunt, the Home Office's chief statistician, said the latest fall in the figures might be seen as surprising because of expectations that the economic recession would lead to an increase in crime, particularly property crime. He said the new figures showed further substantial falls in car crime – down 17% – and domestic burglary, down 9%.Blunt said that the British Crime Survey was the best long-term measure of trends in violent crime, which showed a significant fall between 1995 and 2005 and had changed little since then.He said the long-term fall in crime had been seen in many developed countries over a similar period.Blunt acknowledged criticisms that the survey did not cover some of the more serious violent crimes, such as homicide, rape and sexual assaults, but said they were well documented in the police figures and the gaps in coverage did not affect the overall trend.Some criminologists have argued that the figures fail to capture new forms of crime such as identity theft and online scams, but Blunt said the latest credit card fraud figures also showed a fall for the first time.The detailed police figures show that the murder rate in England and Wales fell in 2009-10 by 6% to 615, the lowest level since 1997, although still above that of the 1960s, when there were fewer than 400 murders a year.Gun crime fell by 3% last year, with 39 fatal shootings, the same as in 2008-09. These figures, however, cover the period before the recent Cumbria and Northumberland shootings. Fatal stabbings were down from 255 to 205.The one category which recorded an increase in the police figures was sexual offences, which rose 6%, including a 15% rise in rapes against women.The Home Office said the figures had to be treated with caution because the police had recently issued new guidance to improve the recording and investigation of rapes, which may have influenced the figures. The Association of Chief Police Officers said it was encouraged by the increased reporting of rape and sexual assaults.The British Crime Survey continues to show that while people believe that crime has fallen in their neighbourhood, 66% still believe that it has risen across the country as a whole in the past few years. Only 10% believe they live in a high-crime area: "This suggests that the public have a more realistic view of crime in their local area," it concludes.One worrying aspect of the figures is that while the overall number of crimes has fallen, the police detection rate is falling even faster.
