Michael Howard today pushed his family into the electoral frontline as he turned his attack to crime, revealing both his wife and daughter had been mugged.In an aggressive speech on sentencing and prisons in London in which he declared the Conservatives were the "only party prepared to tackle the politically correct do-gooders head on", the Tory leader pointed out his son had been a victim of car crime, in addition to the muggings of his wife, Sandra, and daughter, Larissa.Mr Howard attacked both Labour and the Liberal Democrats as he emphasised the Tories' six-point action plan on crime: fixed minimum prison sentences for people who commit three offences; published minimum sentences for all criminals; an end to Labour's early release programme; the introduction of an "any force necessary" defence for householders and a choice between rehabilitation and prison for young drug addicts.Labour immediately counterattacked, with the home secretary, Charles Clarke, claiming Mr Howard's pledges were "worthless and unravelling".He said: "Mr Howard has promised to start building 20,000 extra prison places within the first month of a Conservative government. The Tories have costed this policy at £760m per year."And the Tories' pledge would also incur an extra £2 bn capital costs of building extra prisons in the first place. Yet the Tories' own spending plans admit that they have only found £125m for this policy."Although Labour yesterday promised special lawyer "advocates" for the victims of serious crime in crown court trials, Mr Howard today denounced crime as "an issue where only the voice of the do-gooders seems to be heard: those who make excuses for criminals; who talk about criminals' rights, not yours".Mr Howard introduced his stepson, son and daughter on stage at the Tories' spring conference this year and today he detailed their personal accounts of being victims of crime, telling the audience in Barnes: "Sandra was mugged. So was my daughter, Larissa. My son, Nick, had his car stolen."And yet my family has suffered just a fraction of what other families have suffered, if that."It was not the first time Mr Howard had used his family as case-studies in his election campaign; he previously told audiences his mother-in-law died of the hospital superbug MRSA, and spoke of the death of his grandmother in the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz when attacking the BNP.Both Tony Blair and Charles Kennedy have set down clear ground rules that they will not talk about their families, although Mr Kennedy did pose with his newborn son, Donald, at the beginning of the campaign.Continuing his attacks on Labour, Mr Howard said: "However hard Labour's spin doctors try to blow smoke in our eyes with junk statistics, hard working families understand the reality. Accusing Mr Blair of a "lack of leadership, a lack of political will, and a lack of courage" he concluded: "Instead of standing up to the rights of the majority, Mr Blair has bowed to the do-gooders."Crime is traditionally a strong Tory card at election time, although a breakdown of polls this time show the party only leading Labour consistently on immigration.But Mr Howard also attacked the Liberal Democrats, saying the party were "barmy" to suggest abolishing mandatory life sentences for murderers, or giving prisoners the vote.He said: "When I go around the country and tell hard working families what the Liberal Democrats' policy on crime is, they are stunned."In fact, the Lib Dems argue their policy is intended to give judges discretion in sentencing between cold-blooded killers and abused wives taking revenge, for example.
