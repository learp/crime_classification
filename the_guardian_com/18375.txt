The father of the stabbed schoolboy Damilola Taylor yesterday pledged to devote the rest of his life to preventing other youngsters from growing up to be yobs or killers.Richard Taylor said children from deprived areas needed better education and more opportunities to steer them away from the sorts of crime and antisocial behaviour perpetrated by his son's killers.His comments came after two teenage gang members from Peckham, south-east London, Ricky Preddie and his brother Danny, were convicted on Wednesday of Damilola's stabbing six years ago.
