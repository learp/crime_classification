Matt Weaver (Rough Justice, August 27) is right to question whether the criminal justice system is the best way of dealing with street beggars. Many of those who end up begging on the streets will already be victims of the "revolving-door" syndrome: a series of arrests for minor offences, followed by short prison sentences and a return to homelessness and social isolation. These people frequently fall through the gaps in traditional social services and end up misusing drugs and alcohol and reoffending. The current raft of punitive anti-social behaviour measures will simply add to the problems of this group, resulting in further overcrowding of prisons and little or no benefit to the community.
