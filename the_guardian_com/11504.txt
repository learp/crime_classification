Probation officers have admitted to lacking the skills and training necessary to protect the public from sex offenders, according to an independent investigation into the police and probation services.Even experienced officers say they lack vital support and claim that, because of excessive workloads, they feel "unable to engage effectively with offenders and challenge their behaviour", the criminal justice joint inspection study finds.Public protection work with registered sexual offenders in the community is being undermined through those failures, the report concludes.There are more than 44,700 people on the sex offenders register for England and Wales, according to the latest available figures, which end in April 2009.The law requires any sex offender sentenced to a jail term of at least 30 months to be placed on the register for life.More than half of convicted sex offenders living in the community are released from jail under condition they take part in behavioural programmes. But the report finds that delays in starting treatment programmes are leaving offenders living in public for a substantial time before their abusive behaviour is addressed.The report also finds that offenders are failing to complete their pre-programme work in "far too many cases", reducing the effectiveness of any further treatment courses they complete.Andrew Bridges, chief inspector of probation, said: "The proportion of sexual offenders who are reconvicted of further offending is known to be low. Nevertheless, their subsequent crimes understandably cause considerable public concern. [This] inspection revealed … areas where practice by both police and probation … threatened to undermine the efficacy of work with registered sexual offenders."Many of the probation staff we met during the inspection said they felt inadequately trained or supported to work with sexual offenders outside the group-work programme."This "lack of confidence" was curtailing the effectiveness of staff contact with offenders, Bridges said.Denis O'Connor, the chief inspector of constabulary, said time was also an issue. The investigation found that the workloads of probation offender managers averaged 30 to 50 cases, but in one area they were up to 90. "Managers carrying this number of cases would, in our opinion, be unable to engage effectively with offenders and challenge their behaviour," O'Connor said.The report also identified serious concerns about the violent and sex offender register (ViSOR), a confidential national database of sexual, violent and other potentially dangerous offenders used by the police, prison and probation services.Vital intervention plans, prepared by the probation service to prevent offenders re-offending, were also found to be dangerously wanting. "Too many … were of insufficient quality and did not include some of the interventions used with sexual offenders, such as regular home visiting by the police or use of a sexual offences prevention order," said O'Connor.Criticism was also raised about the quality of case management by Mappa, the multi-agency public protection agency."We had serious concerns, in some areas, about the lack of robust processes … and the high proportion [of cases] that were being managed without any form of multi-agency oversight," the report said.Donald Findlater, director of the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, a charity concerned with the welfare of offenders and victims and which aids the police, the national offender management service, and Mappa, said the report's findings were "unsurprising".Findlater said: "I'm not surprised if an observation is expressed that probation officers appear to be deficient and that they're feeling unsupported or potentially inadequate. I have been concerned as to the quality of training being made available to those managing sex offenders in the community for some time."
