Greater Manchester police recorded a 63% rise in homophobic crime. Acting Detective Superintendent Gerry Campbell, of the Metropolitan police, who headed a recent operation against hate crime that led to 292 arrests, said: "Homophobia cannot be considered a thing of the past, it's on the increase."A confidential briefing note for Scotland Yard's lesbian gay bisexual transgender advisory group, seen by the Observer, says nine "critical incidents" have been recorded in the force's area since March 2008, compared with five incidents from 2001 to 2005. Recent cases include the murders of Daryl Phillips, 39, stabbed two weeks ago in Tottenham, north London, after arriving from Trinidad to escape homophobic bullying, and of Gerry Edwards, 59, knifed when he answered the door in Bromley, south London. His partner, Chris Bevan, 56, was also stabbed.
