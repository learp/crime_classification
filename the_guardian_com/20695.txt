Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAA "caring and loving" mother helped end her daughter's life following a 17-year battle with illness by handing her a lethal dose of morphine and a cocktail of drugs, a court heard today.Bridget Kathleen Gilderdale, 55, known as Kay, passed two syringes filled with large doses of morphine to 31-year-old Lynn Gilderdale, who injected the pain-relieving medicine herself in a suicide attempt at the family home, the court was told.When it emerged that the dosage had not been enough, the mother searched the house for tablets which she crushed with a pestle and mortar and administered to her daughter through a nasogastric tube.In the hours that followed, Gilderdale, described as "devoted" to her sick daughter, gave her three syringes of air through an intravenous catheter with the intention of causing air embolisms.Miss Gilderdale, who had ME (myalgic encephalopathy) – an illness that causes severe and debilitating fatigue – from aged 14 and required round-the-clock care, died later that morning, 4 December 2008, at home in Stonegate, near Heathfield, East Sussex.Jurors at Lewes crown court were told Miss Gilderdale suffered from an "unimaginably wretched" illness and had expressed a clear desire in the past to end her own life.But Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, told the six men and six women jurors that it was not their task to judge the "motives or morals" of her mother or "to choose where your sympathies lie"."It is your job to decide whether the actions of Kay Gilderdale fell outside of the law," she said in her opening speech.Gilderdale denies attempted murder but admits aiding and abetting suicide between 2 December and 5 December 2008.Howes said: "It is the prosecution's case that when Mrs Gilderdale realised that the two large doses of morphine that she provided to Lynn, that Lynn self-administered to try to end her life [had not done] … instead of then realising that her daughter's suicide had gone horribly wrong, she then set about, over the next 30 hours, in performing actions which were designed with no other intention other than terminating her daughter's life."Howes said the prosecution did not doubt that Gilderdale was a "caring, loving and most devoted" mother or that her daughter had expressed a clear desire to end her life."The question for you to consider is what the defendant intended by her actions during those 30 fateful hours – the last 30 fateful hours of her daughter's life."More than a year before her death Miss Gilderdale had viewed the website of Dignitas, the Swiss-based assisted dying group, and she had also instructed a solicitor to draft a "living will".In it she stated she did not wish to be resuscitated or subjected to any medical intervention if her quality of life was too poor, saying she feared "degeneration and indignity far more than death".The court heard that the living will was countersigned by the family GP, Dr Jane Woodgate, who said she was satisfied that Miss Gilderdale was of sound mental capacity at the time.Miss Gilderdale was described as a very happy child in her early years who enjoyed sports and was a keen musician.However in November 1991 she contracted a viral illness, followed by ME.Howes said she suffered at first with panic attacks and spasms, and within four months was unable to move from the waist down and unable to sit up without losing consciousness.She became totally bedridden, losing her ability to swallow, which resulted in her being fed by a nasogastric tube.Jurors heard she communicated through sign language which she developed with her parents, who were divorced.A postmortem carried out at Conquest hospital found that the cause of death was morphine toxicity.The case continues.
