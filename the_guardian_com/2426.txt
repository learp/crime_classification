The "tough and tender" package of five criminal justice bills at the heart of the Queen's speech marks the most sustained attempt yet by the government to redeem Tony Blair's decade-old pledge to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.The home secretary, David Blunkett, hopes the package will seal the Labour's reputation as the party of law and order at a time when the crime rate threatens to resume its upward path after a sustained 10-year fall.The biggest clashes with a conservative legal profession over the main criminal justice bill will centre on some of the measures designed to drive up the appallingly low conviction rates for some crimes - only 9% in the case of rape, for example. So the debate is likely to centre on the rewriting of the rules of evidence. These include changes to regulations on advance disclosure; on the greater use of hearsay; giving the judge the discretion to introduce the previous convictions of the defendant when relevant; and an extension of judge only trials in complex fraud cases and where there is a threat of jury tampering. The House of Lords will attempt to block many of these moves.But while much of the political debate will centre on ministers locked in battle with the lawyers' party in the name of protecting civil liberties, the more radical heart of the package is likely to be overlooked.This involves a whole new approach to the sentencing of criminals, which would keep tens of thousands of short-sentenced offenders out of prison each year, and a major expansion of community penalties. This marks an official Labour recognition that prison is an expensive way of making minor offenders worse. The question of whether this "tender" part of the package will work is less likely to be fought out in parliament than in the cabinet. Unless the chancellor makes extra cash available to the home secretary, the system will simply not be able to cope.When it comes to the politics of law and order, it is public perceptions that matter most. The special antisocial behaviour crackdown is designed as much to do with reducing the fear of crime as it is to cleaning up our high-crime neighbourhoods. This Queen's speech marks a relaunch for this kind of approach, and the omens from the first attempt enshrined in Jack Straw's 1999 crime and disorder act don't look too promising.Â· Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor
