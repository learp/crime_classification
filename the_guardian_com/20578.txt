A 94-year-old man is critically ill after he was attacked in his home during a robbery.The victim was hit in the face and pushed to the floor by one of the raiders at his address in Sale, Greater Manchester.His assailant held the man down while his fellow robber searched the property in Priory Close before taking cash from a jar.The pensioner got out of bed to investigate noises after the two men forced their way into his home at about 4am on Sunday 22 May. He is receiving treatment for a life-threatening brain injury.PC Martin Hill, of Greater Manchester police, said: “This was an awful robbery of a man in his own home, which is a place where a person should feel the safest.“The victim was left all alone injured and in shock on the floor by the two offenders.“They did not give the condition of their victim a second thought, only caring about what they could get their hands on. Given the timing of the incident, it is possible that people may have heard a disturbance taking place before seeing the offenders flee the scene.“I would like to urge anybody with information to please come forward and contact police.”The suspects are described as white men wearing dark blue coats and gloves. One was about 1.73 metres (5ft 7in) and the second approximately 1.79 metres (5ft 9in).Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 7530 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
