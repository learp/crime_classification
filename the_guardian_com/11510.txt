A garden centre owner was cleared of child abduction charges yesterday for making three boys do 90 minutes' manual work as a punishment for trespassing.The youngsters, aged 12 and 13 at the time, cleared planks, tyres and pallets from a nearby stream and repaired a hedge with branches, Plymouth crown court heard. Judge Francis Gilbert ordered not guilty verdicts to be entered in respect of child abduction and common assault charges against Linda Lindsay, 54, her 35-year-old son, Melvin Lindsay, and her 29-year-old nephew, Leigh Docwra. All denied the charges. The judge bound over the three to keep the peace for 12 months in the sum of Â£250. Mrs Lindsay, who has run Woodvale Nurseries in Plymouth for 25 years, said the boys had agreed to carry out the tasks after they were found hiding behind vehicles on the nursery's property on February 23. After they were caught, one of the boys produced a cassette tape he admitted taking from a vehicle, she said. It was then that they were given their tasks. "They said they would rather do that than have the police called," she said. Llewellyn Sellick, prosecuting, told the jury the children were held against their will and had been "manhandled".
