Two members of a drunken gang of youths will be given life sentences today for stamping to death a have-a-go grandfather who had been told that police were "too busy" to respond to repeated 999 calls.James Straiton, who was 59, was one of a terrified group of neighbours whose homes were besieged by the mob as they reeled home from a Saturday night party in Winnington, Cheshire.Two ringleaders, Joshua Spruce and Nigel Gould, both 20, were yesterday convicted of murder unanimously by a jury after a five-week trial at Chester crown court. Mr Justice Roderick Evans told them that life sentences were manadatory but adjourned the hearing until today to consider minimum terms.He told the court that there had been serious public and police concern that 999 operators told six callers to try non-emergency lines because front-line officers were so busy. He said: "There has been a high level investigation ... and it is apparent from the information gathered that there was an extraordinarily high degree of police commitment at the time." Straiton, a taxi driver, was repeatedly kicked "like a football," the jury heard.
