What happened?The 126,000 members of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, have voted against proposed changes to their pay and conditions by a majority of 10-1.What was the offer?The home secretary, David Blunkett, intended to raise all annual pay scales by £400 and introduce an extra "competence-related" pay tier, paying a bonus of £1,002. There were also payments for officers in specialised or difficult jobs of between £500 to £5,000 a year. But overtime rates and allowances would also fall, and officers would have been required to work more flexibly.Is this just a pay dispute?No. The police federation chairman, Fred Broughton, said the ballot produced "a massive and significant rejection" of proposed reforms, including plans for a new breed of civilian warden and greater centralised control over chief constables. Mr Broughton said the ballot reflected a lack of trust in the government's agenda.Why does the government want to reform the police?It is seen as the last unreformed public service, having largely avoided the initiatives foisted upon other public sector workers. "There is a big missing factor on the liberal left and that is that we have forgotten crime and disorder and the misery this brings," Mr Blunkett said in December. He believes that public confidence in the police is falling.What is the state of policing in Britain?Detection rates are down to 24%, while conviction is even lower at 9%. Clear-ups do differ across the country, but while reported crime is on the decrease nationwide (burglary has dropped 43% in seven years) the fear of crime, especially street crime, has risen and there are ever present public demands for more officers on the street.What does the government propose?In Policing a New Century, the white paper, Mr Blunkett sets out a series of measures including a new non-emergency number to function in a similar manner to NHS Direct, the lifting of a ban on foreigners serving in the police and more direct power for the home secretary to act over "failing" police forces and to dismiss incompetent officers.The most controversial proposal is for thousands of uniformed community support officers (CSOs) to patrol the streets, tackling low-level, antisocial crimes - a cheap way to get more bobbies on the beat and free up trained officers to deal with serious crime. They may be given police-style powers to use "reasonable force" to detain suspects, possibly with batons and CS sprays.What are police complaints?The Police Federation, which represents the rank and file, condemns the proposals as "policing on the cheap" though senior officers welcomed the proposals, appeased perhaps by Mr Blunkett's promise to ensure there are 130,000 police officers in England and Wales by spring 2003.
