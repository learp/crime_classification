A 26-year-old man who was last week arrested at Heathrow airport on suspicion of terror offences has been charged with kidnap of a British journalist and a Dutch colleague in Syria.The Metropolitan police said Shajul Islam had been charged with imprisoning John Cantlie and Jeroen Oerlemans against their will and would appear on Wednesday at Westminster magistrates court.A woman who was also arrested at Heathrow on suspicion of terror offences after arriving with Islam on the same flight from Egypt last Tuesday has been released without charge.Cantlie, who had worked for the Sunday Times as a photographer, was abducted with Oerlemans and held captive for a week in July.They eventually managed to escape from the camp in northern Syria with the help of the Free Syrian Army, but Cantlie said one of his captors had claimed to be an NHS doctor.He told the Daily Mail that the man had a south London accent and used saline drips with NHS logos on them."I asked for his help as we were both from London, but he refused to even send a text to my girlfriend to say we were alive," Cantlie told the newspaper."He said he would be beheaded if he did. It wasn't much fun expecting to end up on an execution video at the hands of extremists â€“ one of whom was treating Londoners like me a few months ago."Scotland Yard said Islam and the woman were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The charge alleges that Islam, with others, unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned John Cantlie and Jeroen Oerlemans against their will, between 17 and 26 July.
