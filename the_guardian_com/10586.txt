The Home Office forensic pathologist who failed to disclose key microbiology results from the postmortem examination on Sally Clark's baby son Harry will face charges of serious professional misconduct before the General Medical Council today.The hearing, due to last four weeks, could see Alan Williams struck off the medical register.Mrs Clark's conviction in 1999 for killing Harry and his brother Christopher was quashed in 2003 because the jury at her trial were unaware of the results of tests on tissues and fluids from Harry's body, which were not disclosed to other expert witnesses or to lawyers in the case. These showed the widespread presence of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in his body, indicating he could have died from natural causes, and casting doubt on the murder verdict in Christopher's case as well. The test results were not unearthed by the defence until after Mrs Clark's first appeal had been thrown out in 2000. Dr Williams is charged with failures over the postmortem examinations on both babies. He denies serious professional misconduct and is expected to argue that he believed the presence of the bacteria resulted from contamination during the postmortem and was therefore not relevant to the cause of death. When Mrs Clark's first son, Christopher, died aged 11 weeks in 1996, Dr Williams gave the cause of death as a lower respiratory tract infection. His postmortem on Harry, who died aged eight weeks in 1998, put the death down to shaken baby syndrome. After Harry's death he re-examined the material retained after Christopher's postmortem and changed his opinion, deciding there was evidence of smothering. The GMC claims he failed "to discharge his duty as an expert witness". Dr Williams was criticised by the appeal court judges who quashed Mrs Clark's conviction. They said his failure to pass on the test results created a "significant risk of a miscarriage of justice".
