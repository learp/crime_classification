A married couple have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 25 years each for murdering the wife's parents, burying their bodies in the back garden and stealing £250,000 of their savings.Susan Edwards, 56, and her husband Christopher, 57, were found guilty last week of shooting dead Patricia and William Wycherley at their home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in May 1998.Sentencing the pair at Nottingham crown court on Monday, Mrs Justice Kathryn Thirlwall told them they would both serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars.The Wycherleys' bodies were unearthed last October from the back garden of their home, where they had lain undiscovered since 1998.In a 15-year deception, the murderers tricked friends and family into believing the Wycherleys were still alive while spending their way through £250,000 of their victims' savings.The Edwardses frittered away tens of thousands of pounds on an eclectic collection of celebrity memorabilia, including £14,000 worth of collectibles relating to 1950s actor Gary Cooper and an autograph collection worth £20,000. On arrest they were £160,000 in debt.At the same time, Susan Edwards kept up the pretence that her parents were alive, sending Christmas cards to relatives assuring them all was well. In one, she told a relative her father was enjoying his "second youth", travelling in Ireland.The deception started to unravel last September when the couple fled to Lille, France, after being spooked by letters from the Department for Work and Pensions requesting an interview with William Wycherley to continue his benefits. There had also been letters from Buckingham Palace congratulating the late William Wycherley on what royal officials believed was his upcoming 100th birthday.Having run out of money and unable to find work, Christopher Edwards called his stepmother and made a confession: Susan had found her father dead at the hands of his wife and, following a confrontation, she had killed her mother. They had then buried the Wycherleys and lived off their benefits, he said.The couple were arrested in October 2012 when they voluntarily handed themselves in to Nottinghamshire police after learning that detectives were investigating the buried bodies.Detectives believe the crime's roots lay in a financial grudge held by Susan Edwards against her parents for years before the Wycherleys – who were 85 and 63 when they died – were shot dead in their bedroom in May 1998.Sentencing the pair, Thrilwall said they had acted together to carry out the "shocking crimes" and deserved to spend most, if not all, of the rest of their lives in prison.The judge said: "I have no doubt that you were acting together, you Susan Edwards encouraging Christopher Edwards at the scene and assisting him later in concealing the bodies to which I shall turn in a moment. You are each as responsible as the other for these crimes and I see no reason to distinguish between you on sentence."DCI Rob Griffin, of Nottinghamshire police, said after the sentencing: "The Edwards' version of events just didn't sound plausible right from the very beginning and following a lengthy and difficult investigation we were able to pick apart their story."It was through good old-fashioned detective work that we were able to separate fact from fiction. The Edwardses were their own worst enemies in the end. It was in the finer detail of their own story that we were able to expose their lies."
