Police in Greater Manchester say there was no "obvious motive" behind the fatal shooting on Boxing Day of a student who was visiting Salford for Christmas.Anuj Bidve, a 23-year-old from India who was studying at Lancaster University, died after he was shot in the head at close range in the early hours. Officers have appealed for witnesses to come forward with information about the "awful attack".The victim was with nine fellow Indian students at the time of the incident. His parents, who live in India, have been informed of his death. Greater Manchester police said the group was heading towards Manchester city centre when two men approached and engaged the victim in a "very short" conversation.Moments later the killer pulled out a weapon and shot the student, who collapsed to the ground as his killer ran off towards the Ordsall estate. There is nothing in witness statements to suggest the attack was a robbery or racially motivated or that the students knew the two men.Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan said: "The family have been made aware of what has occurred and this tragic set of circumstances. There is going to be a huge amount of concern in the community and I can reassure the family and the community by telling them we have launched a major investigation and no stone will be unturned so we can find the people who are responsible for this."We are only going to solve this with the help of the community. We need witnesses to come forward who were there at the time of these events and who may have seen these people running away."If it was your brother, son, husband or friend who was killed while visiting another city you would want justice, so please help us do the same. Sadly, there are still people out there with access to guns and as this tragic incident shows, it takes just a second for someone with a gun to deprive a family of a loved one."The officer, who is divisional commander for Salford, urged the killer and his accomplice to turn themselves in."You need to surrender yourselves to the police as soon as possible. This was an awful attack which appeared to be unprovoked on a young student who was just going about his business."The murder took place a few hundred yards from the Wellington pub, where there was a fatal shooting in September, but Mulligan said there was no connection between the two killings at this stage.He added: "There is bound to be anxiety in the community about this but we have got an increased police presence in the area, we have got a thorough investigation going on and we have done a huge amount to bring down crime in the area."I don't want to detract from the seriousness of this incident but violent crime in the city is down overall and it seems rather crass to discuss that at this point but it's important to say that, generally, Salford and Manchester are safe places to be."Police are looking after the other students until they return to Lancaster.The university said : "Lancaster University can confirm that the man killed in Salford early this morning is a 23-year-old Indian postgraduate student, who was studying micro-electronics."Our thoughts are with his family at this time, and counselling and support has been organised for his fellow students, who are deeply upset."
