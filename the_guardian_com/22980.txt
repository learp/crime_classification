The "inside man" in Britain's biggest robbery used a miniature video camera no bigger than a 50p piece fitted to his belt to help plan the £53m raid, the Old Bailey heard today.Albanian Emir Hysenaj used the hi-tech equipment to take secret footage of operations at the Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent, where he worked, the jury was told.The pin-hole camera was fitted to a pair of jeans and a belt with the use of cardboard and stitching, it is alleged.A month later the depot's manager, Colin Dixon, his wife and their child were kidnapped before seven robbers carried out the raid, the court heard.Mr Hysenaj, 27, of New Road, Crowborough, East Sussex, is among seven men and one woman on trial over the hold-up in February last year. All deny the charges.It is not alleged that Mr Hysenaj was one of the robbers but the prosecution says he was used to supply key information about the layout inside the depot.The jury was shown a picture of a similar miniature camera to the one he allegedly used to record the footage alongside a 50 pence piece.Another defendant, Lea Rusha, discussed plans for the reconnaissance in a mobile phone conversation with an alleged co-conspirator, the trial was told.The man, who cannot be named, was said by Sir John to have accidentally recorded the "very revealing" conversation on his phone, discovered later by police, which included a discussion about fitting the camera to a pair of jeans.Mr Rusha is also alleged to have suggested that the week when Mr Hysenaj's duties would involve walking around the depot rather than sitting at a desk would be best for him to carry out the surveillance.Sir John Nutting QC, prosecuting, said a sales manager at Eyetec, a shop in Chesterfield, Derbyshire specialising in surveillance equipment, spent two hours fitting the camera "little realising the use to which it was going to be put".Mr Hysenaj began working at the depot two months before the robbery and was said by a fellow employee to have taken "a considerable interest in security". He allegedly carried out the reconnaissance on January 16 last year, just over a month before the heist.The court heard that the gang penetrated bunker-like security at the depot by using a combination of "kidnap, disguise and threat".It was alleged that the robbers were able to take the haul away in a lorry despite CCTV cameras, a high steel fence and a double-locked strong room for holding money.Sir John said: "The design of the building is aimed at deterring attack. It looks like a bunker."The gang was alleged to have used prosthetic masks to pose as policemen in order to kidnap depot manager Colin Dixon, his wife and their child, using the knowledge of an "inside man" to carry out the robbery.They were said to have dreamt of a life of "luxury, ease and idleness". Police have so far recovered only £21m of the £53m haul.Sir John told the jury today that the 24-hour depot was used to store large sums of money for retail outlets, shops and supermarkets as well as the Bank of England.He detailed the security at the depot: "There are no windows providing natural light other than small, hardened glass portals which allow control room staff to view those accessing or exiting the building. The building itself is surrounded by a high steel fence."Air locks are used to transfer cash between vehicles and the building so that security staff delivering or collecting from the building do not have to enter it."Cash that is not actually being counted or sorted is kept within the depot's internal vault."This strong room has two doors and a double key system so that it cannot be accessed by any single person, with the exception of the manager."As the events of this case show, in spite of those measures, the depot remained vulnerable to the use of kidnap, disguise and threat."Roofer Mr Rusha is alleged to have been "at the heart" of the conspiracy and to have masterminded the reconnaissance of Mr Dixon's home, the court heard.Mr Rusha, 35, of Lambersart Close, Southborough, Kent, was linked to a lock-up garage near his home, where £8.6m was found, and to another cache of £1.3m discovered in Ashford, Sir John said.He told the court that car salesman Stuart Royle, 48, of Allen Street, Maidstone, helped with the reconnaissance of the Dixon family and was possibly one of the kidnappers and certainly one of the robbers.John Fowler, 58, a former business partner of Mr Royle's, is said to have provided the lorry used in the robbery. He allegedly allowed his home at Elderden Farm, Staplehurst to be used to hold the Dixons and to divide the spoils of the robbery.Mr Hysenaj was said to have been linked to them through fellow Albanian Jetmir Bucpapa, 26, of Hadlow Road, Tonbridge.Garage owner Roger Coutts, 30, of The Green, Welling, Kent, allegedly had strong links to the discovery of £9.7m at premises in the town.Hairdresser Michelle Hogg, 32, of Brinklow Crescent, Woolwich, south east London, admitted disguising four men with prosthetic masks but denied knowing how they would be used.Signwriter Keith Borer, 53, of Hempstead Lane, Maidstone, Kent, denies a charge of handling stolen money.All except Mr Borer are charged with conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to kidnap Mr Dixon and his family and conspiracy to possess firearms. They deny the charges.The trial, which is expected to last four months, continues.
