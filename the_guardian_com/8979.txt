Desperately worried about local gang and youth violence. We have to get a grip."Community leaders have made several attempts to make the area safer in recent years. Yew trees and a herb garden in a chequerboard pattern were planted along John Fearon Walk after it was identified as a hotspot for antisocial behaviour.
