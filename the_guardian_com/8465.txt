The parents of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler vowed yesterday not to rest until her killer was brought to justice.As Bob and Sally Dowler prepared for a private funeral service for Milly on the first anniversary of her disappearance, they appealed to anyone with information which might provide a breakthrough in the investigation to come forward.Milly, 13, disappeared while walking home from school in Walton-on-Thames on March 21 last year. Her decomposed body was discovered six months later in Yateley Heath woods in Hampshire, more than 20 miles from where she was last seen.Despite an investigation which has involved police forces across the country and cost Surrey police £2m, detectives remain baffled as to when, how and where the schoolgirl died.In a written statement released yesterday, her parents said that the anniversary of their last day with Milly was a "poignant occasion" which they felt should be marked by finally laying her to rest.But they added that although the funeral would provide some peace for their daughter, they would not find solace until the mystery of her disappearance was solved."We will not be able to rest ourselves until we see whoever is responsible for murdering our daughter brought to justice," they said."Someone, somewhere must know what has happened to Milly, or have suspicions about who is responsible. Please, please contact the police if you know anything that might help. Nothing can bring our daughter back, but at least let us see her killer brought to justice."The Dowlers confessed that they were trying to carry on as best they could for Milly's sister, Gemma, 17, but that it was a daily struggle against the pain of their loss.A police spokesman confirmed that Surrey police and Crimestoppers were offering a £50,000 reward for information which would lead to the killer.
