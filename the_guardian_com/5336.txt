Several hundred people yesterday marched through the streets of Inverclyde, Scotland, to protest against the spiralling culture of knife crime which has blighted the lives of families across the country.The demonstration was organised by family and friends of teenager Darren Pyper who was fatally stabbed in an argument at a party last September. The 14-year-old schoolboy died from a single wound to his leg during a fight at a friend's house in Gourock.William Brown, 64, was charged with Darren's murder, but died from heart failure in Greenock prison before he could be tried for the crime. Police officers, teachers and local councillors joined members of the general public at a bench dedicated to Darren's memory in the town centre before marching to nearby Battery Park for a day of poetry readings, songs and the performance of a play on the dangers of knife crime.'We're all emotional, but trying to hold our heads up high and trying to get by the best we can,' said Kendall Gregory, 17, a friend of Darren and one of the organisers of the march.'We want to show people how hard it is for us one year after Darren died. The march took place as several thousand people - including victims of violent crime and bereaved families - paraded through London in a peace rally to help stem the tide of young people dying as a result of knife crime throughout the UK.
