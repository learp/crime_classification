Eight people have been arrested in connection with the murders of British honeymooners in Antigua.They are currently in custody and are being interviewed by officers on the Caribbean island, Inspector Cornelius Charles said. He said some of them "may be considered prime suspects" and that more arrests may be made as the day goes on. Ben Mullany and his wife Catherine, both 31, from Pontardawe, south Wales, were shot in the head during an apparent bungled burglary on the last day of their honeymoon in their cottage at the Cocos Hotel and Resort on the Caribbean island.Two women were yesterday charged in connection with the killings.It is understood those charges related to goods stolen from the couple.The couple, who were married on July 12, were buried on Wednesday in a private ceremony in the same church in Wales where they had exchanged their wedding vows a month earlier.Their families said in a joint statement that a memorial service would later be held for extended family members, friends and colleagues.Swansea coroner Philip Rogers released their bodies for burial when he opened and adjourned an inquest into their deaths on Tuesday.The coroner was told that Mrs Mullany, a doctor, died instantly in the shooting and Mr Mullany, a trainee physiotherapist, later died at Morriston Hospital, in Swansea.At the hearing, the coroner heard that postmortem examinations had been carried out and the "provisional" cause of death in both cases was a gun shot wound to the head.More than 30 people have been questioned so far in connection with the shootings on July 27.
