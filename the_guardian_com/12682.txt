A nurse has been stabbed to death in the grounds of a community hospital in Essex, police said today.The woman, believed to have been in her 30s, was found by staff at St George's Hospital, in Hornchurch, shortly after 11am. She was pronounced dead at the scene.She is believed to have been repeatedly stabbed while on a break in a garden area at the rear of the campus-like hospital complex."Somebody found her in the smoking area," Imelda Distura, a 34-year-old trainee nurse, said. "We are all frightened. Everybody is upset. I think the domestic was the one who found her."Police said they were keeping an open mind about the motives and circumstances behind the attack. A murder investigation has been launched.The hospital is the headquarters of North-east London Mental Health NHS Trust, although it has few services for mental health patients and cares mainly for children and the elderly.Karen Jennings, the head of health at the nursing union Unison, described the incident as "sad and shocking". "It is tragic that, yet again, a nurse has died while carrying out her work caring for the sick and injured," she said."The level of violence that nurses and other health workers face is simply unacceptable, and we will be demanding a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding this terrible event."
