Social workers today met the parents of Madeleine McCann to discuss the case of the missing four-year-old and the welfare of their two other children.Representatives of Leicestershire social services spoke to Gerry and Kate McCann - who were last week named as official suspects in their daughter's disappearance - at the couple's home in Rothley. It is standard procedure for a mother or father named as a suspect overseas to have their case considered by the authorities in their home county on child protection grounds. Mr McCann's brother, John, who spent the night with the couple, told the Evening Standard: "Kate has invited social services to make sure everything was OK - that was at her behest." A spokesman for Leicestershire county council said it could not comment on individual cases.Local police and council staff met on Monday to discuss the couple, their two-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie, and the disappearance of Madeleine. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the case, it is possible that a child could be taken into care or placed on the "in need" or "at risk" register. Earlier today, moves by the Portuguese authorities to examine Mrs McCann's private diary were condemned by her sister-in-law as "just another way to stick the knife in".The diary is among a number of personal items prosecutors want from the McCanns, sources close to the investigation said.Detectives also want to seize Mr McCann's Apple laptop computer, which he used to write his blog on the findmadeleine.com website, the sources told Portuguese journalists.Portuguese police have passed on a request to the British authorities to take the possessions from the family's home, according to reports, although Leicestershire police have not confirmed this.Mrs McCann was frequently seen writing in her journal during private moments after Madeleine went missing from the family's holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz 133 days ago.It is understood that Portuguese legal procedures require a judge's permission for some items to be seized.On Tuesday, the Policia Judiciaria passed a 4,000-page dossier of evidence to the Algarve-based public prosecutor, Jose Cunha de Magalhaes e Meneses.He immediately ordered that the 10 lever-arch files should go before a criminal instructional judge, understood to be Pedro Daniel dos Anjos Frias.The prosecutor made a number of requests of the judge, among them that he approve the seizure of Mrs McCann's personal diary, the sources told Portuguese journalists.One newspaper reported that the authorities had taken it last week, along with correspondence belonging to the McCanns.The judge was being asked to approve seizure of the documents retrospectively to comply with laws prohibiting "abusive interference in their private lives", the Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Noticias said.It said the diary would help police "understand the couple's habits" and supply clues to the investigation.
