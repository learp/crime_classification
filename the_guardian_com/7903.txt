A zero-tolerance approach is needed to tackle the growing problem of teen gangs, a thinktank said today.Up to 50,000 young people are caught up in gang culture, says a report from former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith's Centre for Social Justice.The report calls for gang leaders to be served with new gang activity desistance orders (gados), which could see them jailed for breaches. The orders would be issued by courts as a "last resort" in areas where people were too intimidated by gang violence to help the authorities tackle the problem, its Dying to Belong report said.But it added that unlike antisocial behaviour orders (asbos), which have become a "badge of honour" for some youths, they should be strictly enforced and carry "serious repercussions".The "gado" scheme is part of a package of US-inspired measures put forward by the report, including a project which saw gang leaders in Boston told to end violence and receive drug rehab, remedial education and help finding work, or face constant attention from the authorities and prosecution for the most minor offences.Other ideas include setting up "gang prevention zones" in the worst-affected areas, where police, councils and other agencies would focus efforts to get youngsters out of trouble.Duncan-Smith said: "The tragic murder of Rhys Jones in Liverpool has brought home the casual savagery of gang crime in Britain today. Half the 27 teenagers murdered in London last year were the victims of gang crime. That should bring home the brutal truth that street gangs are a nasty and shocking symptom of the broken society."We need emergency action in stemming the rise of gang culture which is devastating our most disadvantaged communities."
