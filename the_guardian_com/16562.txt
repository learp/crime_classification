Hundreds of mourners gathered yesterday for the funeral of 16-year-old Kodjo Yenga, who was stabbed on a west London street in March.His uncle, Lubi Takson, who said they were at last taking 'our beloved Kodjo to his final place of rest', made a plea afterwards for young people to co-operate with the family's campaign against knife crime by providing police with evidence if they witnessed such incidents. Friends and family filled the streets as they walked from the Notting Hill home of the sixth-form student to the church of St Francis of Assisi for the service, which was followed by a private burial.Eight teenagers aged between 13 and 16 have been charged with the murder of Yenga, who died from a single wound to the heart. Four of them appeared at the Old Bailey last Thursday and will appear for a hearing on 15 June, joined by four others.
