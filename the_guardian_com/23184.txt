A man in a wheelchair who was caught on CCTV carrying a television stolen during the summer riots has been jailed for a year. David Knott, 18, of Bromhedge, Eltham, south-east London, was caught on camera as an accomplice put an Alba television on his lap before pushing the wheelchair away. Knott, who had a broken leg at the time, was jailed at Inner London crown court for handling stolen goods belonging to an Argos store in Woolwich, south-east London. Police officers working on Operation Withern – the force's investigation into August's riots – are continuing to make arrests.
