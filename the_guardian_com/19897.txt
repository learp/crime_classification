There is a Â£10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.Greater Manchester Police said that McMullen was arrested on suspicion of escaping from lawful custody while the other men, aged 27 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.Three men, including one who is believed to have been carrying a sawn-off shotgun, were involved in the attack on the GEOAmey prison transport vehicle last Tuesday.Police had released images of MacDonald and McMullen and warned that the latter, in particular, posed a danger if approached.When he escaped, MacDonald was due to be sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle taking.
