The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday January 28 2008 In the article below we mistakenly repeated the misconception that Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, had received compensation of almost £200,000 for the loss of an eye in Broadmoor hospital 10 years ago. West London Mental Health NHS Trust has asked us to point out that no such payment was ever sought or made.The eldest daughter of the Yorkshire Ripper's first murder victim killed herself in the week before Christmas, West Yorkshire police said today.Police found Sonia Newlands dead in her Leeds home on December 19. It is believed she hanged herself. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances.Newlands had been battling alcohol addiction in a rehabilitation centre before her death.Her mother, Wilma McCann, was the first of Peter Sutcliffe's 13 victims. The 28-year-old was attacked with a hammer and stabbed several times on playing fields behind the Leeds council estate where she lived in October 1975.Newlands, who used her mother's maiden name, was the oldest of McCann's four children. When their mother didn't return home that night, she and her brother Richard, then seven and five, went to wait at the bus stop McCann normally used.In 2005, Newlands told a BBC documentary about her continuing grief. "I think most people remember the number 13 - for the number of women he killed. But what about the children - there's 25 of them and no one remembers them."Her brother Richard served time in prison on drugs charges before publishing two best-selling books - Just A Boy and The Boy Grows Up - about his troubled childhood.Newlands' funeral is expected to take place early next month.Sutcliffe murdered 12 more women after McCann between 1976 and 1980 and has been held in Broadmoor hospital for nearly 26 years.Ten years ago he lost his eye when a fellow inmate attacked him, something for which he received nearly £200,000 compensation. Last week another inmate attempted to gouge out his other eye by plunging a knife into his face.
