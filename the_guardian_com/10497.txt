A nurse at the centre of alleged saline tampering at a hospital has been sacked, sources have confirmed.Rebecca Leighton, 27, was released without charge six weeks after being arrested on suspicion of murder when patients at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester, were poisoned.Charges that she had tampered with saline solution with intent to endanger life were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.The Nursing and Midwifery Council later lifted its suspension of Leighton, who has always denied the allegations, and said she could return to Stepping Hill if the hospital approved.During the NMC disciplinary hearing she admitted stealing opiate-based drugs but said they were for her own use to treat a throat infection.It emerged on Friday that she has been sacked following an internal disciplinary hearing at Stepping Hill into the drug thefts.Stockport Hospital Foundation Trust has declined to comment as it is understood Leighton has the right to appeal before the decision is finalised.
