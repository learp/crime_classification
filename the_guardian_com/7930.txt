Dramatic footage of the final, fatal actions of Mark Saunders, the barrister who was shot by police marksmen after firing a gun of his own from the window of his Chelsea home, were shown to an inquest jury today.Video shot by a police helicopter showed the drunk 32-year-old waving a shotgun in the air as he hung from the fourth-storey kitchen window of his home in Markham Square.As negotiators desperately pleaded with him via a loud hailer and mobile phone to put the gun down, Saunders slowly lowered the long-barrelled weapon. As it reached a horizontal position a volley of shots rang out from armed officers stationed on and in three buildings that backed on to the property.Saunders doubled up and was flung back into his kitchen by the force of five bullets fired by seven officers that hit him in the head and chest, causing fatal injuries. The final shots came after three and a half hours of extraordinary negotiations between Saunders and a team of officers trying to end the siege peacefully.Audio recordings of the negotiations, police tactical discussions and a 999 phone call by Saunders were played at Westminster coroner's court, sitting in Marylebone. They revealed that in Saunders's last clear communication with police he said it would be "painless" to shoot himself and he wanted to speak to his wife to say goodbye.Saunders then told police he "needed to blow off some steam" before blasting the shotgun through his window again at 9.09pm, provoking police to fire two shots that did not injure him. Over the next 23 minutes, police unsuccessfully tried to re-establish contact with Saunders as he stood at the kitchen window, holding the shotgun in one hand. At 9.32pm, illuminated by a helicopter spotlight, Mr Saunders is seen holding the gun in the air and appears to shout at officers surrounding his home before he is fatally shot.
