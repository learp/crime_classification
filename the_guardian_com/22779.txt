The attorney general has warned the media to be careful in their reporting in the wake of the arrest of Dale Cregan, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering two unarmed women police officers in Manchester on Tuesday.Dominic Grieve's office issued a note to the press and broadcasters late on Tuesday after what it described as "intense media coverage over the shootings of PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone" in the immediate aftermath of their murder.At that point several broadcasters and newspapers were reporting emotional allegations made by the Manchester chief constable about the alleged circumstances of the two officers' deaths and similar remarks by made by David Cameron. Nevertheless, some newspapers carried the quotes in their print editions on Wednesday.The attorney general's office warned that Cregan has now been arrested on suspicion of the murders and the earlier deaths of two others and that newspapers should be minded of "the risks in publishing material that ... risks interfering with the administration of justice".Such advisory notices are normally confidential to the media, but the attorney general's office agreed that its existence could be made public when contacted by the Guardian.Reporting of alleged crimes and their perpetrators is restricted from the moment an arrest is made and proceedings are "active" under the Contempt of Court Act 1981.The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Guardian and the Daily Mail, were among those printing comments made by the Manchester chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, and the prime minister.However, a more circumspect Times reported that it contacted Grieve's office on Tuesday evening and "was given advice that constrained the newspaper from reporting the full comments of both the prime minister and Sir Peter" because they had both made "direct allegations about an individual".A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office said it would not be providing any comment on Wednesday's press coverage of the killings and that it was keeping a "watching brief". But the senior government lawyer's office indicated that it did not provide an specific guidance to the Times, over and above what was sent to all media.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
