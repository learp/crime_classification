A British lawyer alleged to be at the centre of an international bribery scam was accused of trying to persuade a colleague to give false evidence to prosecutors, a court heard today.The accusation against north London lawyer Jeffrey Tesler has been levelled by American prosecutors who are seeking to have him extradited to the US to stand trial.The prosecutors accused Tesler, 61, of helping to organise a decade-long operation to pay bribes worth $132m (Â£81m) to Nigerian politicians on behalf of a consortium seeking $6bn construction contracts.At Westminster magistrates court in London, David Perry, QC for the US prosecutors, alleged that Tesler had attempted to persuade the colleague, Jack Stanley, to give false evidence by telling the US authorities that money was being used for currency swaps instead of corrupt payments. Stanley, an American executive in the consortium, faces seven years in jail after admitting to US prosecutors that he conspired to pay bribes to Nigerians.He is hoping for a reduced sentence and has provided evidence to the US prosecutors.Halliburton, the US engineering giant whose subsidiary headed the consortium, last year paid a record $579m fine in the US after admitting its role in the payments.Perry told the court that there were "compelling reasons" to extradite Tesler. Tesler's QC, Hugo Keith, countered that the US connection to the London lawyer was "tangential", arguing that little of the alleged bribery took place in the US.The hearing against Tesler, who denies any wrongdoing, is one of a series of controversies over extradition in which the UK is alleged to send more suspects to the US than the other way.District Judge Caroline Tubbs adjourned the hearing until 25 March when she is expected to announce whether Tesler must be extradited. The US prosecutors also want to extradite a second Briton, Wojciech Chodan, over the same bribery offences. His hearing is due to start on 22 February.
