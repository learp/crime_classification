Meredith Kercher, the Leeds university student murdered in Italy, was the victim of the "convergent actions of more than one person", according to judges in Perugia, the city where she died. A document explaining why bail has been denied to the suspects in the case outlines the evidence against them and supplies a new version of how Kercher died.The judges last week denied bail to Kercher's American flatmate, Amanda Knox, and Knox's Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, who has dual Italian and Ivory Coast nationality, is expected to be deported to Italy from Germany today. All of the suspects deny any wrongdoing.Kercher was found dead on November 2 with her neck and throat slashed. Though a judge overseeing the inquiry earlier asserted that Kercher died slowly, colleagues who reviewed the evidence to decide if the suspects should remain behind bars concluded that her death "if not instant, took place in a short time".Prosecutors believe Kercher was killed while resisting a sex attack. Evidence of all three suspects has been found at the scene of the crime. Guede is alleged to have left a fingerprint on Kercher's bloodstained pillow. His DNA profile was also found in faeces in the toilet. Police experts have identified a bloodstain in the bathroom as belonging to Knox.The judges dismissed claims by Sollecito's lawyers that a footprint in the bedroom where Kercher was found did not belong to their client. The judges said "full compatibility between the footprint and the sole of Sollecito's shoe" enabled them to rule out the possibility that it might have been left by a similar-sized shoe belonging to Guede.
