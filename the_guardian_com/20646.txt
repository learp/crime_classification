A man who lost his girlfriend to his work colleague is thought to have killed them both before committing suicide, it emerged yesterday.The bodies of a man and woman, both 23, were discovered on Monday afternoon in Ambrosden, Oxfordshire, just hours after a 41-year-old man was found dead less than four miles away in Bicester. Police are not thought to be looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.Both scenes were the subject of forensic examinations yesterday. At first police had believed that the older man was murdered and the couple may have committed suicide, but last night they said that the situation was thought to be the reverse.A postmortem examination on Dean Irvine, 41, from Leach Road, Bicester, was inconclusive. It had been understood earlier that he may have taken a drug overdose as well as injuring himself.Neighbours said that until recently he had been seeing a younger woman, who had left him for his colleague at the dairy where he worked.The injuries suffered by the 23-year-olds, named as Craig Bentley, a milkman, and his girlfriend, Becky, a nursery worker, were not divulged, but it is understood at least one of the victims was stabbed."There were no obvious signs of forced entry at Laburnam Close where the two bodies were found in separate bedrooms upstairs," a police spokesman said yesterday.Postmortem examinations on the couple were being carried out yesterday at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford and results were due to be released today.Tributes were left in Ambrosden outside Mr Bentley's home.
