Victims of the taxi driver sex attacker John Worboys are preparing to sue him for hundreds of thousands of pounds in damages, lawyers said today.Solicitors representing several of the women he assaulted have begun drawing up a civil claim against the black-cab driver, hoping to strip him of assets including homes in Rotherhithe and Dorset, as well as substantial savings.Worboys, 51, was convicted of attacking 12 women in the back of his cab after drugging them with spiked champagne and other drinks.Detectives said they believed he could be behind 73 similar unsolved attacks on women across London over six years.A judge jailed him indefinitely last month and said he should not be released until parole officials consider he no longer poses a threat to women.Solicitor Alison Ludwell, of Garton & Co in Leeds, specialises in recouping compensation for sex attack victims and is responsible for the claim.She said: "At the moment we are looking at potentially a civil claim against John Worboys. I am very confined in what I can say because of client confidentiality."But there are several victims that have come forward already and I shall be taking a view with counsel's advice about how best to proceed."Ludwell said Worboys's victims could claim cash from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) but were reluctant to do so because it was public money.The trial judge Justice Penry-Davey has already handed the 12 victims the proceeds from the sale of Worboys' £5,000 cab and £3,680 of cash seized by police.The money was in a carrier bag Worboys stashed in the front of his cab and used as a prop to support his false story that he was celebrating a casino or lottery win.The handling of inquiries into serious sex attacks by the Metropolitan police has been severely criticised since his conviction.Independent investigators were brought in to investigate a series of missed opportunities by police in this case and others.
