A teenager who persistently harassed a man in his sixties with severe learning difficulties up to the day of his death was yesterday detained in a young offenders' institution.David Askew, 64, collapsed after confronting youths in his garden in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, in March and died a short time later.Officers were called after reports that youngsters had caused a disturbance at the house he shared with his brother Brian – who also suffers learning difficulties – and their 89-year-old mother Rose.Kial Cottingham, 19, who lived nearby, admitted persistently harassing Askew for cigarettes over a three-month period and pleaded guilty to using intimidating, threatening and aggressive behaviour. He was given a 16-week sentence.At Tameside magistrates' court, the chairman of the bench, Ken Mortimer said: "The harassment was over a long period and to a vulnerable victim. The distress of the victim was ignored, which had a psychological and physical affect."Cottingham was banned from entering a designated part of Hattersley for three years or contacting the other members of Askew's family.Vanessa Thomson, prosecuting, told the court the Askew family were close-knit and looked after each other. Because of his difficulties, David was known as "Dopey Dave" and would bite the back of his hand when he became upset or agitated.She said: "He was seen as a soft touch by youths who targeted him."They would shout up to his bedroom and he would throw money or cigarettes down to get rid of them." She said children also threw stones at the window.In January, CCTV captured Cottingham outside the house aggressively confronting David Askew.Askew visited a neighbourhood housing office twice in two days to complain about his behaviour.A shopkeeper said she had seen about 50 incidents involving Cottingham and Askew.A neighbourhood police officer spoke to Cottingham in February and told him to stay away from the family, the court heard.The day after Askew's death, Cottingham gave a television interview in which he claimed he was "shocked" about the incident and said he would often step in to deter other local youths from constantly haranguing him.He was also questioned on suspicion of manslaughter but was cleared of any involvement in Askew's death.Tarick Sadiq, defending, said his client was remorseful and wanted to apologise to the family for any harm caused.A post mortem examination later concluded Askew died of natural causes – heart failure caused by long-term heart disease and undiagnosed oesophageal cancer.Greater Manchester Police assistant chief constable Garry Shewan said: "David's death was a tragedy. First and foremost our thoughts must be with his mum Rose who has been through an extremely traumatic few months."David was an extremely kind, happy person and Rose and the rest of David's family have had to cope with a huge loss in their lives."Rose Askew said her son had been through hell. "It was not just one incident – it went on for years," she said. "Sometimes he would cry and ask me if I could move people out of our garden because they were calling him hurtful names." She thanked police who had called to see her every other day since her son's death.
