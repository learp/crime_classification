An 88-year-old great-grandfather has escaped being jailed for breaching his antisocial behaviour order (Asbo) because of his age. Alexander Muat, believed to be the oldest man in Britain to receive an Asbo, was today found guilty at Liverpool crown court of three breaches of his order. The jury cleared him of a further three breaches and one charge of putting a person in fear. But judge David Lynch said: "There will be no prison for an 88-year-old man." Mr Muat, a retired RAF engineer, from Huyton, Merseyside, was accused of repeatedly harassing his neighbours, Alison and Derek Fowler. He denied all the allegations and claimed he was the real victim of harassment. In July last year Mr Muat, who is profoundly deaf, became the oldest man in the country to receive an Asbo. The order banned him from making excessive noise by banging doors and bin lids, filming his neighbours, swearing and shouting at them and driving his car into other people's driveways. The case was adjourned today for sentencing on November 13.
