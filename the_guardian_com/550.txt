Detectives searching for missing mother-of-four Samantha Henderson have found a body in a lake.The 25-year-old has not been seen for more than a week after leaving Corfe Castle Primary School in Dorset on 21 January.Police launched a major missing person inquiry and her boyfriend, Dominic Isom, 27, has been charged with her murder.Dorset police said a body, believed to be that of Henderson, was discovered in a lake at Ham Common in Poole at around 1pm on Friday.Henderson, who has children aged six, four, two and one, was reported missing at 8.43am on 22 January.Detective Inspector Neil Devoto, who is leading the inquiry, said: “Family-liaison officers have updated Samantha’s family with today’s development.“Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy. Her children are being cared for by relatives.“I would like to thank the public for all their help during this investigation and their patience and understanding, in particular the communities in the Corfe Castle and Hamworthy area who have seen a great deal of police activity over the last week.“I am still keen to hear from anyone who saw Samantha’s blue Peugeot 307 estate car with the registration HV04 ZFM being driven in the Lake Pier and South Haven Close areas between 3pm on 21 January and 5pm on 23 January to contact me in confidence.“I am urging anyone who saw anything suspicious in this area between the relevant times to get in touch.”The Dorset coroner has also been informed of the discovery and formal identification is yet to take place.Isom, of Halves Cottages, Corfe Castle, appeared at Winchester Crown Court today where he denied Ms Henderson’s murder. He will face trial later this year.The charge alleges he murdered her on 21 January – the day she was last seen alive.
