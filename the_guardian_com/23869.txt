A 90-year-old woman thought to have been strangled by a fellow resident in a care home was named by police last night. Nora Baldwin was found dead at Longbridge Deverill House, near Warminster, Wiltshire.Officers have arrested an 84-year-old woman in connection with the death and have ruled out euthanasia as the motive for the killing. The women did not share a room and were both known to mental health services in Wiltshire.Following the death, doctors said the accused was unfit for interview by detectives and she is currently at a new care home, where she is on bail. Baldwin had been a resident at the home for three years. The 84-year-old had lived at the home since 2003.Detective inspector Nicki Davey, who is leading the investigation, said: "It is a tragic incident and while we are keeping an open mind, there are no lines of inquiry linked to euthanasia. Staff and residents at the home are shocked and they have been quite profoundly affected by the circumstances in which one of their residents has died."
