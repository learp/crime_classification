That the Pilkington inquest has been, in the words of the guidance for coroners, "full, frank and fearless", is largely down to the efforts of one person: Olivia Davison.Throughout the hearing, the assistant deputy coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire made it clear, sometimes in the face of trenchant opposition, that she wished the jury to examine the wider context of the deaths, particularly the harassment and abuse faced by the family.One moment of particular drama came when, in the absence of the jury, the elegantly pinstriped barrister for Leicestershire police, Richard Perks, said Davison's approach had been too "challenging and judgmental" and suggested restrictions on media coverage, or even a new hearing.The coroner listened patiently before delivering a response that was simultaneously withering and impassioned."It is one of the glories of this country that the press is allowed to report from the courts," she told him, peering over her reading glasses. " A coroner's inquiry should make sure the facts are fully, fairly and fearlessly investigated. I should not hide from asking inconvenient questions."She added: "The most important people in this inquiry are the family and that they leave this inquiry with an answer. They have lost a mother, a daughter and a granddaughter."
