Criminal trials are set to be dramatically shortened to curb the soaring budget for criminal legal aid, under a package of reforms to be unveiled by the lord chancellor today.The aim is to stop the escalating costs of defending those accused of crimes from eating up the funds intended for helping the disadvantaged with housing, debts and other problems.The reforms, to be unveiled in a strategy document today, will mean the end of long trials such as the £60m Jubilee line extension fraud case, which collapsed after 21 months because some jurors were unwilling or unable to go on any longer."The days of the 18-month trial are over," said Lord Falconer.Most cases should not last longer than "a few months at the very, very most", he said.The plan is for judges to manage cases tightly from the beginning, with the prosecution encouraged to narrow the issues in dispute to cut down on the number of witnesses.The judge will specify how long the case should take and lawyers may be paid for that time only, even if the trial goes on longer."If a properly examined tender is made but a piece of work takes the provider three months longer than expected, the person who should pick up the price of that is not the purchaser of the service but the provider of that service," the lord chancellor said.The government also plans to take forward controversial plans for the most complex fraud cases to be tried without juries, a move certain to meet strenuous opposition in both the Commons and the Lords.The provision is already in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, but in a last-minute deal to salvage the legislation, ministers agreed that it would not be brought into force without an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament.Lord Falconer said no final decision had been taken on whether to go ahead with that measure, which would allow trial by judge alone, or to examine other alternatives, such as a judge sitting with expert assessors.The lord chancellor said the legal aid budget had risen from £1.5bn to £2.1bn a year since Labour came to power in 1997, but spending on civil legal aid had fallen by 22%."There are too many areas where people don't get the advice and representation that they need at an early enough stage," he said.Lawyers say the civil legal aid system is close to crisis, with legal aid "deserts" opening up around the country as law firms pull out, citing low pay rates and excessive bureaucracy.Mentioning the collapse in March of the Jubilee line extension fraud trial, Lord Falconer added: "We can all think of cases where disproportionate amounts of money have been spent on unsatisfactory outcomes."Another example was a series of trials over an £8m legal aid fraud in the West Country, which took 10 years and £40m, excluding prosecution costs.Asked whether the proposed reforms could result in prosecutors opting for lesser charges that were easier to prove, Lord Falconer said: "Yes, I think it could lead to a risk of that. That's why it's sensible to keep open the option of juryless trials."Other reforms in his department's programme include the new supreme court, which he expects to be sitting by October 2008, and the new judicial appointments commission, which should be up and running by spring 2006.A Bar Council spokesman indicated that the pay proposals would receive a rough ride from barristers."Lord Falconer will be making a mistake if he underestimates the very real anger at the criminal Bar about the way fees for most cases have been slashed," he said."He's trying to suggest that lawyers are exploiting the system when in fact it is the government exploiting barristers."
