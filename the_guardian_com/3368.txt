ITV1 has commissioned a police documentary series funded by the Central Office of Information that ties in with a recruitment campaign.Beat: Life on the Street will follow officers from Oxfordshire and Liverpool on patrol and off duty.It's understood the deal was set up via media agency OMD. The series ties in with a recruitment campaign being run by the Home Office called "Police - Could You?".ITV declined to reveal how much the series has cost or how much the Home Office has contributed, but it could be as much as 100% of the budget.Filming will include footage of officers on the beat as they talk to residents about crime in their area.In an attempt to "personalise" the police force, the series' makers, TwoFour, will also show officers at home with their families.An ITV spokeswoman denied the fact the COI is funding the series would compromise what might be shown."The programme will be made within the appropriate guidelines. It is early days yet, too early to say in much detail what will be shown," she said.It's not the first time ITV has helped support government campaigns. Two years ago, the network launched "Britain on the Move" to encourage healthier habits.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
