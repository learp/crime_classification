A woman who admitted an attempted mercy killing on her dying father was disowned by her family yesterday after she received a suspended 12-month prison sentence. Relatives of Jennifer Allwood, 41, who carried out the attempt after a drinking session, said she should have been given "a proper sentence" and spent Christmas and next year at least in jail.Allwood, from Cleethorpes, was fought off by her dying father Alexander Thow, 67, who had stomach cancer, when she tried ineptly to smother him with a pillow. Hull crown court heard that he pushed her away and shouted for help, as she told him: "I'm going to finish it, Dad."Prosecutor Simon Waley said that she had been drinking and had used "some force". After her father twisted away, shouting "You can't do that," she made a second attempt, telling him: "This is cruel. You are not going to make Mum suffer and you are not going to suffer either."Allwood, who has previous convictions for benefit fraud, assault and causing criminal damage, admitted attempted murder in the attack in June. Her barrister, the former cabinet minister Douglas Hogg QC, told the court that she was severely stressed at the time, after discovering that her husband was having an affair.She was pulled off her father, who died of cancer four weeks later, by her daughter Lisa-Marie Kavanagh, who ran into the room after hearing shouts. The court heard Allwood rang the emergency services herself and said: "I've been trying to put my father out of his misery."The recorder of Hull, Michael Mettyer, told Allwood that if her actions had hastened her father's death, a prison term would have been inevitable. As they did not, there was "no point' in adding to the prison population.After the hearing, Thow's younger daughters, Fiona, 38, Judy, 36 and Cherylee, 35, said that they had disowned her. Judy Thow said: "She should have been locked away for what she did."
