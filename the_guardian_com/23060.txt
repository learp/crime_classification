The UK is experiencing a huge rise in the number of dog fights, the RSPCA said today, as it revealed the number of complaints it received about the illegal "sport" had increased by more than 10-fold in three years.The charity received 358 calls specifically about dog fighting last year, 132 of them involving youths or hoodies training their dogs to fight in the street or park.The latest figures are up from 137 dog fighting complaints in 2006. In 2004 the figure was just 24.The animal rescue charity's experience was mirrored by police figures, which showed the number of dangerous dogs seized in London had nearly trebled in a year.Tim Wass, the RSPCA chief officer of the inspectorate, said the figures confirmed "there is a real problem at the moment with people using dogs for aggression and fighting"."Our concern is that talk of dog fighting promotes images of 'dangerous' or 'devil' dogs, when in the vast majority of cases, it is the owner who is causing the problem, not the dog," he said.Metropolitan police statistics revealed 280 dogs were seized in London under the Dangerous Dogs Act, in the year to April 2008. That compares to 173 the year before. Between 2003 and 2006, the average was around 38 dogs a year.The Met said there had been no special push on "dangerous dogs" and the figures just reflected a rise in the number of incidents it was called to. The RSPCA is holding a summit in London today to discuss dangerous dogs.Lord Rooker, the minister for sustainable food, farming and animal health, is launching a new Defra leaflet at the summit on so-called "status" dogs. "It is important that people understand the law, as this may deter irresponsible dog owners from allowing their dogs to be dangerous," he said.
