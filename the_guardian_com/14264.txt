The probation team which was widely criticised two years ago for its handling of the case of Craig Sweeney has failed to make progress in its public protection work, according to a report from the chief inspector of probation published today.Andrew Bridges says that despite the best of intentions by probation and police leaders in Gwent to improve their work in dealing with ex-prisoners who pose a high risk of harm to the public they have mistakenly believed that improvements since made at a strategic level have actually led to changes in practice on the ground.Sweeney abducted and sexually assaulted a three-year-old girl in January 2006 just two days after his prison release licence expired. He had been imprisoned previously for indecently assaulting his six-year-old stepdaughter. Sweeney was caught after a car chase along the M4 and is now serving a life sentence.The chief inspector of probation says that, as in the Sweeney case, three offenders regarded as a risk to the public from South Wales were placed in probation accommodation in Gwent without the two probation areas having communicated with each other. All three cases took place between August and December last year."We were not satisfied that the Mappa (prison) systems were effective," Bridges reports. "We found that there has been undoubtedly been much well-intentioned activity by probation, police and others ... regrettably those intentions have not been matched by progress on the ground."Bridges says that 14% of offenders who had been assessed as posing a risk of harm to the public had been put in the wrong category. The quality of the probation assessment was sufficient in only three out of the six public protection cases looked at in detail.
