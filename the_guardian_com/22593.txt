The IPCC is in complete agreement with the sentiments expressed in Stafford Scott's piece on the Mark Duggan case (This inquest can't be secret, 28 March). The IPCC is not seeking to withhold information but has alerted the coroner that there may be relevant material we will be legally prevented from disclosing to him or the interested parties. We have drawn this to the coroner's attention now because we considered it fair and right to warn him and the family early of these potential difficulties. We won't know if we can share all the relevant information with the coroner and Mr Duggan's family until we've completed our investigation. The coroner has set a further pre-inquest hearing for 23 October for these issues to be discussed. It is because the IPCC believes information should be disclosed to the deceased's family and the public that, in March 2009, we made a submission to the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the proposals in the coroners and justice bill on non-jury inquests.Rachel CerfontyneIPCC commissioner
