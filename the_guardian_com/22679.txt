A 12-year-old charged with grievous bodily harm for flicking paper at a classmate with an elastic band has had the charge dropped after a four-month legal ordeal.The boy, who has not been named, was held for four hours in a London police station before being released on bail in June. His mother, a hospice manager from Balham, south London, described the case as "ludicrous" and claimed the stress had led to her son having epileptic fits. "What happened is ridiculous and wrong. Yes, it was a silly game and, yes, he hurt someone. But he didn't mean to," she said.The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case after tests showed the victim had not suffered permanent damage. Boys had been flicking elastic bands at each other at school; apparently one refused to take part and was allegedly targeted and suffered bleeding and swelling to his eye.The defendant's mother added: "Afterwards, he did everything I would have expected - he apologised, looked after the boy, took him to the bathroom and then to a teacher. He shouldn't have been flicking but he is a 12-year-old boy."The family's solicitor, Richard Conley, said: "After murder and attempted murder, GBH is the third most serious offence. It's the kind of charge they lay against people who commit stabbings and glassings."A CPS spokesman said: "An alleged attempt to cause an eye injury has to be taken very seriously. The CPS brought the initial charge because we were informed that the boy had lost sight in one eye. As with all cases, it was kept under review."When the medical evidence confirmed that there was no permanent damage to the eye, the charge was downgraded to assault. After further review a decision was taken to discontinue the case as not in the public interest in view of the boys' ages, the effect of a court case on them, and the fact that the harm caused was only minor in the end."
