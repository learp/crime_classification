Police hunting for the murderer of Joanna Yeates today revealed that one of her socks was missing when she was found.Yeates was not wearing her coat or boots when her body was discovered on a roadside verge on Christmas morning.The coat was hanging up at her flat in Clifton, Bristol, and her boots were also there, but the grey ski sock remains missing.Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones, who is leading the murder inquiry, said he had an "open mind" about whether the sock had been kept by the killer as a trophy. He also said he had an "open mind" over whether Yeates may have been strangled with the long sock.Yeates went missing from her flat on 17 December and her body was found three miles away eight days later. She had been strangled.Until now, police had said only that she was "fully clothed". But Jones confirmed that she had not been wearing her boots, the light-coloured coat she was last seen in, or one sock.At a press conference, he held up a size five sock he said was similar to the missing one.He said: "I am here this morning to talk to you about a missing sock. When Jo was found on Christmas Day morning in Longwood Lane, although she was fully clothed, she was not wearing her jacket, she was not wearing her boots and she was only wearing one sock."The jacket and the boots have been found at her home address. That would indicate that Jo had returned home. However, at this present time the sock has not been found."Jones said the sock could be in the possession of the killer, in a house or in a vehicle. He refused to say whether any other items were missing from Yeates's flat, in Canynge Road.There have been increasing concerns that Avon and Somerset police appear to be no closer to finding the killer.However, Jones insisted he was happy with the progress of the investigation and said he had "sufficient" staff.Avon and Somerset police said they were bringing in outside experts to help, but would not confirm that a criminal profiler was being used to build up a picture of the offender.Jones said police had viewed footage from a pub's CCTV system – images from which were published in the Mirror today – early in the inquiry.He said it was "possibly" the last image of Yeates, but police do not appear to think that two figures caught on the same camera soon afterwards are suspects.Jones said forensic work was still continuing at Yeates's flat, and could take weeks. "It is painstaking, meticulous work," he added.He said the police were looking at a theory that the killer had been planning to leave her body in the quarry close to the spot where she was found, but had ended up dumping it on the verge.Police revealed that since an advert was placed on Facebook yesterday, it had been seen nearly 250,000 times and hundreds of people had clicked through to the police's contact form.There have also been more than 70,000 views of the appeal on the Avon and Somerset police website, and more than 120,000 people have watched CCTV footage of Yeates posted on YouTube.Since the appeal, there have been another 267 calls made to the incident room, as well as 75 emails and other calls to Crimestoppers.Jones emphasised that the case was complex and was being "meticulously investigated".One person has been arrested so far – Yeates's 65-year landlord, Chris Jefferies, who remains on police bail.
