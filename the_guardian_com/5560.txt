Detectives in the north and Scotland are to intensify the questioning of a sex killer about a string of murders after a judge added two life sentences for rape to his earlier convictions for kidnapping and strangling a schoolgirl.Poacher John Taylor, who is thought to have used his game freezer to hide 16-year-old Leanne Tiernan's body, is now suspected of carrying out at least four unsolved murders of women in Yorkshire.Scottish police are also comparing details from the murder of Leanne and the two rape hearings, which ended in Leeds this week, in the hunt for the killer of six Glasgow prostitutes. Taylor, 46, a van driver, was a regular visitor to the Scottish city where another prostitute has claimed he frequented a brothel used by some of the dead women.The plan to step up interrogation was given impetus by the rape convictions, which relied on evidence collected during the inquiry into Leanne's death.The recorder of Leeds, Judge Norman Jones QC, said yesterday that Taylor should not be allowed to walk freely again.Taylor's initial refusal to cooperate with the rape inquiry changed as he was presented with more and more damning evidence. His counsel, Richard Reed, said he now admitted the two attacks. Ev idence linking the murder of Leanne with the rapes, and, potentially, the unsolved murders, includes DNA material and methods of attacking the women. Leanne is thought to have been killed after her blindfold slipped during rape, and she recognised Taylor as a neighbour in Leeds.Superintendent Chris Gregg of West Yorkshire police said: "Following Taylor's conviction for Leanne's murder, we carried out research into a number of attacks and murders of women in the Leeds area and across the county. Further forensic work was carried out on DNA samples collected at the time which matched that of Taylor."The rapes took place in Leeds in October 1988 and March 1999, a year before the disappearance of Leanne.The murders under investigation are of Yvonne Fitt, whose body was found near where Leanne was discovered; Lindsay Jo Rimer, who disappeared from Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, in 1994; Deborah Wood, whose partly burned body was found in Leeds in 1996; and Rebecca Hall, who was strangled last year in an alley in Bradford.Strathclyde police are investigating possible links with the killings of Diane McInally, 23; Karen McGregor, 26; Leona McGovern, 22; Marjorie Roberts, 31; Tracey Wilde, 21; and Alison Wallace, 31.
