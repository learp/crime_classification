A woman who claims she was wrongly convicted of murdering her aunt 13 years ago will be released on parole next week, her earliest tariff date. She is thought to be the first person to be freed on schedule while still protesting their innocence. Susan May, 60, will leave Askham Grange open prison, near York, next Tuesday after serving 12 years for the murder of her aunt, Hilda Marchbank. She has continued to contest her conviction and says she will leave prison with a "heavy heart" because she wished to be be released as an innocent person.Speaking from prison, she said she hoped her case would set a precedent for early parole for other prisoners who are "in denial". May, who has been a model prisoner, said she had been told many times by parole officers, psychologists and prison staff that unless she admitted her guilt, she would never get out of prison. "Until I have cleared my name, be it in or out of prison, I will remain locked up," she said. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is considering whether to refer her case back to the appeal court for an unusual third time. John McManus, spokesman for the Miscarriages of Justice Scotland organisation, which has supported May throughout her sentence, said he was pleased with the news. "Her case may help to stop the perverse treatment of those other prisoners who are in denial of murder. "I fear though that her fight against conviction may leave her in a limbo land with no sight of closure until justice is done."
