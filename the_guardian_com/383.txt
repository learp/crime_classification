Your article on lap dancing clubs in Glasgow (I like my job, says the lap dancer, August 21) seems to be more interested in shooting the messenger than addressing the important issues involved. If Glasgow city council has decided to act on Julie Bindel's report, it suggests that it was a substantive and robust piece of work.The council is to be commended for commissioning the research and taking this issue seriously. Against Ms Bindel's apparently extensive research, your article offers a quotation from a 19-year-old lap dancer who says she likes the work (what else is she going to say?) and an extensive quote from one of the lap dancing club owners who, surprisingly, does not like the propriety of his and other clubs being questioned. Recent research from Sheffield has shown the overlap between lap dancing and prostitution, and the ways in which young women are being exploited in these establishments. A wide-ranging group of progressives, including feminists and non-feminists, are campaigning to unionise sex workers, protect their their rights and limit abuses within the sex trade. Indeed, rather than pretend that there is no problem, as your article seems to do, there is an urgent need for more detailed research into the operation and proliferation of lap dancing clubs as well as of the growth of the increasingly lucrative sex industry in Britain.
