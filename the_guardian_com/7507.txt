Detectives were yesterday questioning a man over the murder of a scientist who was found stabbed 49 times and strangled with her own sweater at her flat in Oxford. Officers were also searching the flat of Barbara Waldron-Johnston, an expert in cot death, and the terrace house in Faringdon, Oxfordshire, where the arrested man was staying.There was no sign that the scientist's flat had been broken into, suggesting she may have opened the door to her killer. Dr Waldron-Johnston, 55, had not been sexually assaulted, and nothing appeared to have been taken from the flat.Dr Waldron-Johnston's medical research work included animal experiments, but police are not thought to be treating suggestions that the killing could have been the work of animal rights extremists as a serious option.Dr Waldron-Johnston, who studied at Oxford University, returned to the UK four months ago after working for 23 years in New Zealand, and settled back in Oxford.Last week her parents, who had not heard from her for several days, raised the alarm and at 1am on Thursday police broke down the door of her one-bedroom flat off Woodstock Road, not far from Somerville College, where she had studied. Her body had many stab wounds and her sweater was around her neck.Yesterday Dr Waldron-Johnston's parents, Anthony, 80, and Valerie, 79, from Walsall, West Midlands, described her as a "dedicated research scientist who strove to forward work in the field of cot death and premature babies". They added: "We are all devastated by her tragic and untimely death. She was intelligent, lively and a devoted daughter and she will be greatly missed by us all."In an entry on the Friends Reunited website posted while she was living in New Zealand, Dr Waldron-Johnston, who was single and had no children, said she could not afford to return to the UK. She added: "But life in the South Pacific is relaxed, peaceful and safe, which must count for something these days."Police believe that she may have come back because her work dried up in New Zealand and because of her father's failing health.A 42-year-old man was arrested on Saturday afternoon at a house in Faringdon, which is about a 30-minute drive from Oxford. The man was being questioned at Abingdon police station.Yesterday Thames Valley police were continuing to appeal for information on Dr Waldron-Johnston's movements over the past week and urged anyone who had seen her or any suspicious activity in the area of her flat to come forward.
