One 81-year-old victim had lived alone at her bungalow in a quiet cul-de-sac in a village in Surrey since her husband died in the late 1980s. She had chronic arthritis, walked with a stick and relied on her home help and friends.On the night of 4 September 1998 she awoke to find a man wearing a black mask standing over her bed. Holding her shoulders, he asked: "Where's your money? I want your money."When she began to cry, saying she didn't have any, he put his hand over her mouth and told her: "Shut up. Don't make a noise. Don't tell anybody."She told him: "I think you're thoroughly mean. I am 81, you know, and the shock could do anything."After searching the room, the intruder pulled the clothing off the bed, took off the woman's underwear, subjected her to an indecent assault and tried to rape her.Her ordeal, according to Jonathan Laidlaw, QC, prosecuting, was "not simply a frightening and a degrading experience" but one which was "incredibly painful". DNA from her clothing, taken at the time, later matched that of Delroy Grant, the prosecution said.The pensioner was too frightened to tell anyone about the attack until the next evening, when she phoned her son. She died a year later from an unrelated condition, so she suffered the attack in the last year of her life.
