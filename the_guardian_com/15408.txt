The father of a teenage girl whose body was found in a river claimed that despite her fears she was under no pressure to enter into an arranged marriage, an inquest heard today.Iftikhar Ahmed, 48, said he did not "necessarily expect his own children" to have arranged marriages and that it was "not something I could decide."The body of Shafilea Ahmed, 17, was discovered on the banks of the River Kent at Sedgwick, Cumbria, in February 2004.She had gone missing from the family home in Warrington, Cheshire, five months earlier.Today Ahmed, a taxi driver, denied claims made in evidence by Shafilea's friends that he and his wife beat his daughter and stole her savings.He said he was a "worried parent" who had driven around "like an idiot" looking for his daughter when she had previously run away from home, in January 2003.Ahmed said he had not alerted police about her most recent disappearance as officers had "laughed" at him on the earlier occasion that she had gone missing.Referring to claims he had stolen Â£2,000 from Shafilea's savings, he said: "We had no idea how much money she had in her account. We wouldn't have access to that account."The inquest at the County Hall, Kendal, heard yesterday that Shafilea had once arrived at school with a cut lip and bruising on her neck.She told her friends that one of her parents had held her down while the other had beaten her.Ahmed denied this saying: "As far as I'm concerned it's not true." He added that his daughter had never directly expressed fears about having an arranged marriage and that he had only found out through a teacher during a meeting at her school.Shafilea disappeared from home before a family trip to Pakistan because she was concerned that "my parents are going to send me to Pakistan and marry me to someone and left there".Her friends said in evidence that the day before she flew to Pakistan she was not aware she was going.But Ahmed said his daughter was aware of the trip "a couple of days" prior to leaving and did not protest. He said: "If the girl doesn't want to go you can't basically force her."He said the question of an arranged marriage was raised before they travelled to Pakistan when his uncle asked if Shafilea would marry his son, Rafaqat.Yet Ahmed claimed to have told him: "It's going to be years before we can even think about it" on account of his daughter's education and wishes coming first.The inquest continues.
