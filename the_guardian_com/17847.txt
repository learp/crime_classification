The discovery by Green Party AM Jenny Jones - the baroness herself - that half of the Met's officers live outside the metropolis came as quite a shock. I had long assumed the figure was much higher than that. Years ago, the then police commander of an inner east London borough told me that, as far as he knew, not only did none of his officers live on the patch they served but that they mostly commuted in from the suburbs or beyond. Why? Because police officers were, by their very nature, suburban and Home Counties sorts of people, he said.His remarks came back to me three years ago when Tory AM Kit Malthouse, who at that time chaired the now defunct Metropolitan Police Authority, spoke publicly about the problem of "police ghettos," by which he meant "villages in Surrey and Hertfordshire which are disproportionately over-populated with police officers, because they like to live together." Malthouse saw this as evidence of a growing, undesirable divide between police and public. Who's to say he's wrong? As MayorWatch reports, the London Assembly's stop and search working group has recently been told that some officers are detached from the communities they serve to the point of being scared of them. Meanwhile, Malthouse's successor as Boris Johnson's policing deputy, MOPAC chief Stephen Greenhalgh, has coughed up a further £20m a year to help officers meet the costs of commuting by train. Jenny Jones argues, quite rightly, that this divide would be narrowed if more London officers lived among Londoners and says the capital's growing, chronic shortage of genuinely affordable homes - which Johnson is doing precious little to address - is largely to blame. The Greens reckon that Greenhalgh's £20m transport subsidy would pay for up to 400 affordable homes a year, enabling Met officers to live among the sorts of people they police. But even if more low price housing was provided for London cops, how many would actually want to live in them?
