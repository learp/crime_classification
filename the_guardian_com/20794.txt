A drunken teenager on an antisocial behaviour order who killed a good samaritan with a cowardly punch from behind was yesterday sentenced to three years' detention.Relatives of the victim, Tom Noble, 52, criticised the sentence on 16-year-old Gary Prescott as inadequate and no reflection of the "devastation caused to family and friends". Prescott initially backed off when Mr Noble and two others approached a gang of teenagers in the Roker area of Sunderland, after neighbours reported that a young girl had been attacked. But after hitting the father of three, he bragged to friends that he "had knocked a bloke out with one punch". Brian Forster QC, prosecuting, told Sunderland crown court that Mr Noble, who was suffering from cancer, was a respected community activist. Prescott, of Downhill in Sunderland, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and breaching the Asbo at an earlier hearing, where a legal ban on naming him was lifted. Judge David Hodson described the attack as cowardly, and told relatives of Mr Noble that the sentence should not be seen as setting a value on the victim's life. Mr Noble's partner, Pauline Cowen, said: "I am not happy with the sentence which does not reflect what has happened, and in particular the devastation to Tom's friends and family."
