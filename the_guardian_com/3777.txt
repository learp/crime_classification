A vicar allegedly presided over hundreds of sham marriages in a "massive and cynical scheme" to exploit vulnerable people and enable illegal immigrants to stay in Britain, a court has heard.Rev Alexander Brown married 383 couples in the four years to July 2009 at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in St Leonards, Sussex, a 30-fold increase on the 13 marriages held there in the preceding four-year period.David Walbank, opening the case for the prosecution, told Lewes crown court: "He conducted each of these wedding ceremonies ostensibly according to the rites of the Church of England but knowing full well these were sham marriages not entered into for the proper reasons but as part of an immigration fraud."Brown is charged with conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration laws with two other men, Rev Michael Adelasoye, a solicitor who specialised in immigration, and Vladymyr Buchak, a Ukranian man who was living illegally in the UK.The "vast majority" of the ceremonies recorded by Brown, 61, in the marriage register at his church were "marriages of convenience" between African nationals seeking to stay in Britain and eastern European nationals who had a right to live in the country through their membership of the EU but who were desperate for money.Both groups were "vulnerable to exploitation", said Walbank. "The European nationals tended to be migrant workers who came to this country in the hope of a better life but found themselves living and working in conditions of real hardship."In one case, Chy Chy Perpetua Ifeagwazi, a Nigerian woman sacked from her job after her work visa expired, spent her wedding night working a night shift in a care home after Brown conducted her marriage to Egidijus Salasevicius, a Lithuanian man who worked in a sausage factory in Bexhill, and who was paid £3,000 for the marriage."She was working that night, the night that should have been her wedding night if this had been a normal wedding arrangement," said Walbank. "Nothing better, we say, could illustrate the bogus nature of this supposed marriage that these two people went through."The crown alleges that Buchak, who pretended to be Estonian despite not speaking the language and operated under the alias Kaido Maesalu, was responsible for "cajoling and persuading" eastern Europeans to join the scam.In another case a 55-year-old Estonian woman, Inge Rajaste, answered an advertisement in Russian and was encouraged by Buchak to marry a 30-year-old security guard, Joseph Nduka, in return for £3,000.Walbank said: "They went through a ceremony of marriage for very different reasons – one of them for cash, the other to obtain enhanced rights to enter, live and work in the UK."The prosecution pointed to suspicious trends in the marriage register at Brown's church. The 13 marriages conducted there in the four years to June 2005 all involved couples with "Anglo-Saxon" sounding names."Thereafter, there was a fairly dramatic and obvious increase in the incidence of African and European names appearing in that register," said Walbank."We say that Father Brown cannot have failed to notice that in a markedly high proportion of cases the marriages at St Peter's church involved black Africans marrying white Europeans with names reflecting that. Even allowing for the slightly unusual demographic of St Leonard's, Father Brown cannot have believed that many of these couples genuinely hailed from his parish."Of the 383 weddings in the four-year period, 90 were between couples who claimed to live on one road close to the church. In the space of one month in the spring of 2009 Brown married four couples who gave their address as the same house on a nearby street. These were false addresses, according to the prosecution.The prosecution said that after his arrest in June last year Brown told police "he had belatedly grown suspicious about the number of weddings going through his church and had planned to cut down on the number of ceremonies". In fact, said Walbank: "In the period prior to his arrest the frequency of the weddings continued to increase dramatically." Almost half the "bogus" weddings occurred in the final six months before Brown's arrest.During the six-week trial the court will hear from some of those who undertook the allegedly sham marriages and were given a police caution. Brown and the other two defendants deny the charges.
