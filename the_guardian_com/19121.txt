A third person has died after a suspected arson attack on a house in Sheffield. The third victim, who was one of the residents dragged from the blazing building, died last night after two days on the critical list in hospital.Murder inquiry detectives are meanwhile questioning a third person arrested after the incident which stunned neighbours in a quiet part of the city's Heeley suburb.Forensic specialists are convinced that petrol or a similar accelerant was used to start the fire, which "erupted" within minutes according to neighbours and eyewitnesses.Two other suspects from the area are already in custody and being questioned about the tragedy on Friday evening, which killed two men at the scene and critically injured the latest victim and one other resident. Neighbours described how two victims jumped from the first floor of the modest mid-terraced house in Albert Road, one on fire, while fire officers wearing breathing apparatus dragged two others out from the blazing ground floor. No details have yet been released about those involved because of problems with tracking down their relatives, but South Yorkshire police said last night that they hoped to release names today. A fourth victim remains critically ill but stable in hospital in Sheffield. Neighbour Cath Davies said that people in the narrow street, whose Victorian houses have no front gardens and open directly on to the pavement, were very upset. Joan Laidler, another resident who has lived in the road for 54 years, said: "Nothing like this has ever happened before round here."
