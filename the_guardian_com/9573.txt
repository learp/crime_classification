"We are looking to establish what happened. Our primary aim is to establish the identity of these two men."We will be looking to establish whether there is any correlation between these shootings and the previous incident."Gull said no one else was hurt and no weapon had been found.Police said they were alerted shortly after 10pm on Tuesday when a member of the public reported gunfire. Locals said several shots were heard.The burned car in which one of the men was found caught fire again on Wednesday as police moved it from the site on the back of a lorry.
