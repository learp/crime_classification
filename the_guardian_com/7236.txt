A man and woman from Manchester yesterday became the first mother and son in the country to be put under an anti-social behaviour order.The ban, which prevents them from using threatening or intimidating behaviour in the city, playing loud music or shouting came after a seven month assault on the sensibilities of their neighbours. Manchester city council began legal action when its previous attempts to stop their disruptive activities failed. Pamela Fuller and her son, Steven, from Openshaw, east Manchester, now risk jail if they break the order. They were served with the order by magistrates and it will remain in place indefinitely. The council received 50 complaints from neighbours about the Fullers, including arguing, shouting, damage to property, drunken behaviour and playing excessively loud music. Local agencies including the east Manchester neighbour nuisance team and Greater Manchester police at first gave advice and then warnings but the pair ignored them. Anti-social behaviour orders were introduced in 1999. Local authorities and chief police officers are invited to apply for an order to protect the community from a named individual alleged to cause harassment, alarm or distress. It is a civil action, but breaking an order is a criminal offence which carries a possible five year jail sentence. Basil Curley, Manchester council's executive member for housing, said: "This sends out a powerful message that Manchester city council will not allow nuisance neighbours to get away with it."
