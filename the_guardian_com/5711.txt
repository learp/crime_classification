A man has been arrested in connection with the murder of artist Margaret Muller in a London park, police said today.Scotland Yard said an 18-year-old man from the Limehouse area of east London was being held in custody at a police station in the capital.He is the third person to be arrested over the killing of Ms Muller. The 27-year-old American was found slumped on a path between a rose garden and a playground in Victoria Park, Hackney on February 3. Ms Muller, who was only 4ft 10in, was stabbed several times in the neck and back while on a morning run. She was discovered by dog-walkers and joggers who heard her screams.Police said last month that she was probably the victim of a random attack but they had not ruled out the possibility that she knew her assailant. The artist was born in 1975 and lived in Northern Virginia before studying and living in England where she attended the Slade School of Fine Art at University College London. On March 6 another 18-year-old man was arrested at his home in the Hackney area in connection with the inquiry but was later released without charge. Twelve days later a 46-year-old man was arrested, but was also released without charge. A reconstruction of events on the day of the murder was the largest ever staged in Britain. Police closed the park to the public for six hours as 93 witnesses, each escorted by a detective, retraced the steps they had taken between 8.30am and 8.35am on February 3. Ms Muller's father, 61-year-old engineer Erich Muller, spoke of his "deep remorse and total devastation" at her death and appealed for help in catching her killer. In an emotional interview on ITV1's Tonight With Trevor McDonald programme Mr Muller, who lives with wife Eileen in the suburb of Falls Church, Virginia, said: "Now I need to accept the fact she'll never come home again. She'll never come around and say 'Dad'."
