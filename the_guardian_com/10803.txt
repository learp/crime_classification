A third man has been charged in connection with Britain's biggest jewellery heist after two others appeared in court this morning under tight security.Clinton Mogg, 42, of Westby Road, Bournemouth, was charged with conspiracy to rob, Scotland Yard said.Solomun Beyene, 24, and Craig Calderwood, 26, appeared at Wimbledon magistrates court charged with conspiracy to steal jewellery and possession of firearms over the £40m robbery at Graff jewellers in central London on 6 August.The two men spoke only to confirm their name, age and address during the short hearing.Calderwood, of no fixed address, had his short straight red hair combed flat and wore a long-sleeved white T-shirt for the 10-minute hearing.Beyene, from St John's Wood, north London, wore a grey short-sleeved T-shirt. He looked briefly at his parents who were watching from the public gallery.Anne Packer, the chairwoman of the bench, remanded the two men in custody and ordered them to appear at Kingston crown court for a preliminary hearing on 1 September.Solicitors for the two men made no submissions and there was no application for bail.After the hearing, Beyene's lawyer, Antonie Xavier, said his client was not one of the men involved in the robbery. "It is totally denied. The CCTV shows quite clearly he could not be the person. He has always denied that he was ever near there. This is a shot in the dark."Police launched a widespread manhunt after the robbery of the luxury jewellery shop in New Bond Street.Another man arrested in connection with the robbery, a 50-year-old from Ilford, east London, was bailed last week after being questioned by police.The robbery is Britain's biggest jewellery heist since a £23m robbery of the same shop in 2003. Another London branch of the store lost £10m in 2007 after two robbers posed as customers.
