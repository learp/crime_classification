People who riot, as well as people who are unable to manage their families, are evidentially inadequate – whether by lack of education, intelligence, opportunity or social responsibility. Benefits systems and social housing exist to help the inadequate live adequate lives. The systems are inevitably flawed and abused, but they prevent many people becoming destitute. The policy of eviction that Eric Pickles and Wandsworth council espouse (Report, 13 August) would destroy what fragile family structures may exist. That may say much about the adequacy of Mr Pickles' and Wandsworth's controlling majority, but they, of course, are secure from penury.Angus ThomsonStreatley, Berkshire • I can see the arguments both for and against evicting tenants involved in the riots. Maybe the community in which they live should decide whether the rioter or their whole household should be evicted. An anonymous panel of local residents could look at written statements from the families involved, neighbours and any relevant agencies and decide whether or not they want the family concerned to remain part of their community.Greg BellmoreLichfield, Staffordshire• When sentencing those convicted of offences in the riots, there seems to be an excellent case for considering restorative justice, especially in those cases where the offender has been caught up in the moment and now feels remorse. A severe custodial sentence, while satisfying an understandable public appetite for punishment, may reinforce the offender's alienation and resistance to authority. Obliging the offender to face up to the victim and the personal consequences of their looting or even arson can lead to restoration of the offender's self respect and often helps the victim to recover.John WebbNunney, Somerset • If one of the costs of being associated with a 14-year-old who was at the scene of a public disturbance is to lose your council house, what is the cost for a politician of being associated with newspaper executives who may have corrupted senior police officers? Do you lose your public office?Chris HumphreysSolicitor, Powell Spencer and Partners
