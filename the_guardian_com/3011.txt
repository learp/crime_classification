Ministers have decided to make it a criminal offence to plaster city centre phone boxes with cards advertising prostitutes after a six year battle between local councils and the 'tart-carders'.The carders will face fines of up to Â£5,000 and six months in prison after the House of Lords approves amendments to the government's criminal justice and police bill next week.Peers are also to be asked to close a loophole in the law to strengthen the power of the police to close crack houses and prosecute the owners.City centre councils, particularly in London, have unsuccessfully waged a long battle to tackle the problem of prostitutes' cards in phone boxes.The only law that can be used against the carders is an obscure part of town and country planning legislation which makes it a civil offence to put up unauthorised adverts.Repeated attempts have failed to persuade the telephone authorities to cut off the phone lines of numbers advertised on the cards. The new law will make it a criminal offence to place an advertisement for prostitutes' services in a phone box.Ministers will have the power to extend the ban to bus shelters and other street furniture if necessary.The trade has become increasingly violent with council cleaning teams being threatened. Last week Westminster council in London appealed to residents to "adopt a phone box'' and band together to tear down the cards.Critics of the clampdown argue that the cards mean the prostitutes are not working on the streets, but indoors.But the Home Office minister, Charles Clarke, said the cards were explicit and offensive: "They can be seen by children. They create a bad impression for overseas visitors and are very much part of the increasingly organised business of prostitution, which exploits and degrades women and children.'' He said the cards often covered up important information such as adverts for the Samaritans and Childline.The move against the owners of crack houses is to clarify the existing drug laws. The 1971 misuse of drugs act only allows specifically for the prosecution of owners or occupiers of houses where cannabis and opium is illicitly being consumed. Police can act against dealers in crack houses, but the amendment to the law will ensure that the owners and occupiers of such places have to cooperate with the police in stopping such activity.The police say that closing crack houses is a difficult challenge. They are often fortified and normally only small amounts of drugs are held on the premises.The time it takes the police to force an entry is usually enough to ensure the drugs are disposed of which can make it difficult to prove the owner or occupier was knowingly concerned in permitting the drug to be supplied there. The new offence will carry a penalty of up to 14 years.
