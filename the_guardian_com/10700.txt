One in three people keep a makeshift weapon beside their bed to protect against intruders, according to a survey published today.Householders confessed to putting items such as golf clubs, cricket bats and heavy torches within reach for self-defence from burglars, researchers found, and more than half said they were prepared to use them.One in five people said they did not feel safe in their home at night and one in 20 burglary victims said they were so traumatised they moved house shortly afterwards.The research for the insurer Cornhill Direct was based on a survey of 4,000 people conducted in June.According to guidance published by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service in the wake of the case of Norfolk farmer Tony Martin - jailed for murdering teenage burglar Fred Barras in 1999 - people are entitled to use reasonable force to protect their home and not expected to make "fine judgments over the level of force you use in the heat of the moment"."So long as you only do what you honestly and instinctively believe is necessary in the heat of the moment, that would be the strongest evidence of you acting lawfully and in self-defence. This is still the case if you use something to hand as a weapon," the guidance says.Cornhill Direct said it recommended security measures rather than leaving it "in the hands of fate". Its spokesman, David Keel, said: "Taking simple and relatively inexpensive steps to make your home more secure, like fitting good door and window locks as well as motion sensitive security lights, are proven deterrents."
