A man has been arrested by police investigating the murders of a couple found dead in their home. The bodies of Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58, were discovered at their home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, by their policeman son on Wednesday.Detectives said they were questioning a 24-year-old man on suspicion of the killings after arresting him in Birmingham on Friday night. The development came hours after a reward of £10,000 was offered for information leading to the arrest of the killer or killers.The bodies of the couple, who had been married for 40 years, were found by their son at their semi-detached home just after 8am on Wednesday. Jason Kolar, an officer with West Midlands police, had gone to the house after family members could not contact the couple.Officers among the 60-strong murder hunt assigned to the investigation have said the couple, who had four children and eight grandchildren, were beaten to death with "horrific" force on the ground floor of their home.Post mortem examinations are understood to have been completed, but police have not yet made the results public. A force spokeswoman said that the delay in publicising the results was to ensure all family members have been informed.The arrest also follows an emotional plea by two of the Kolars' four children for help to catch those responsible. Their 39-year-old daughter, Michelle Kirwan, described them as "the sweetest, kindest people" and said the family's "lives will never be the same".During the emotional press conference, 32-year-old Avtar Kolar, the couple's son, had said: "Somebody out there knows who did this, so please I beg of you help us."Crimestoppers have condemned the double murder as a "vile crime" and offered a reward of up to £10,000 for details leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.Police have repeatedly refused to speculate about a motive for the murders, but said detectives are looking into a number of lines of inquiry, including a rise in burglaries in the area.
