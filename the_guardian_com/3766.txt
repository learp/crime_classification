An arrest warrant was issued yesterday for the Liberal Democrat donor Michael Brown after he breached bail conditions ahead of his fraud trial, City of London police said. Brown, whose company gave the Lib Dems more than £2m before the last general election, was due to stand trial next month on a series of fraud and money laundering charges. But a judge issued an arrest warrant after he breached his bail conditions.A City of London police spokeswoman said: "A judge at Southwark crown court issued an arrest warrant today for Michael Brown. Brown, 42, is due to stand trial on September 8 charged with 18 offences and has failed to comply with his bail conditions. Efforts are being made to contact him. He is charged with money laundering, theft, perverting the course of justice and other fraud-related offences. A further hearing on the case has been listed for August 11."The theft charges are believed to relate to his trading company 5th Avenue Partners, with other counts linked to claims criminal assets were transferred via Spanish bank and HSBC accounts.The Glasgow-born entrepreneur denied all charges against him during a hearing in June. Last December Brown was forced into bankruptcy by his own lawyers because of his failure to pay a £20,000 legal bill.Brown was at the centre of controversy after it emerged he bankrolled the Lib Dems' last general election campaign despite not being registered to vote.He was the subject of an Electoral Commission investigation after it emerged he was not registered to vote in the UK, despite his massive political donations. The watchdog found later that the party could accept the cash from his UK-based company 5th Avenue Partners. Brown said he gave the money because he believed in then leader Charles Kennedy's ability as a future prime minister.
