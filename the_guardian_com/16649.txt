Identity card critics last night accused ministers of playing on the public's fear of identity fraud after a new official estimate claimed that it is costing Britain £1.7bn a year.The Home Office minister Andy Burnham said that the new figure - up from the £1.2bn estimate published by the Cabinet Office in 2002 - was evidence of the need for a secure national identity card scheme to reduce the potential for identity fraud."One of the major breakthroughs that they will bring is the link with a personal biometric, that being a fingerprint or eyescan."Once you link personal facts and figures - address, name, date of birth - to a unique personal stamp, people will have much greater control over the issue of their identity," he said.But both Liberal Democrat and Conservative spokesmen rejected the claim, arguing that ID cards could actually make identity fraud worse as once a criminal had cracked the national identity register they would have access to all kinds of personal information.The new estimate is produced ahead of a House of Lords debate on ID cards legislation next Monday.It is the result of a one-off exercise by the Home Office identity fraud steering committee, based on the methodology used in the Cabinet Office study in 2002."It comprises the cost to a wide range of organisations in both the public and the private sectors but with more up to date figures where these are available, including for the first time a figure of £370m for the cost of identity fraud for the telecommunications industry," said a Home Office spokesman.Since the original estimate was produced "chip and pin" credit and debit cards have been introduced, which the banking industry claims reduced bank card fraud by £36m in the period from January to June last year. They hope for further gains when pin numbers become compulsory replacements for signatures on February 14.Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said it was impossible to see how an ID card would curb credit card fraud unless everyone was going to be expected to show their ID card every time they bought something.Mr Carmichael added: "Putting all our personal data in one place will make the ID card scheme a honeypot for hackers and identity fraudsters."In other words, the ID card is likely to make the problem of identity fraud much worse, not better."Edward Garnier, Conservative home affairs spokesman, said: "Instead of playing on people's fears about ID fraud, the government should take the £15bn which the ID card system would cost and spend it instead on effective measures that will actually reduce fraud and combat terrorism."
