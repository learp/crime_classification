A woman has admitted killing a 58-year-old grandmother in a row over a parking space near a car boot sale.The high court in Glasgow yesterday heard that Carol McMillan, 34, a mother of two, had clashed with Ann Whittle over the space near the busy sale in Glasgow's Blochairn Road. The court was told that Ms McMillan snapped, grabbed Mrs Whittle by the hair and kicked her three times on the head. Mrs Whittle, who suffered from angina, had a heart attack and was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later. Ms McMillan, of Holytown in Lanarkshire, admitted the culpable homicide of Mrs Whittle in the incident on August 15 last year. Her partner, Charles Freeburn, 34, admitted assaulting Mrs Whittle's husband, Norman, by punching him twice. Brian McConnachie, prosecuting, told the court the Whittles had difficulty finding a parking space when they arrived at the sale at around 10.20am. When they spotted a driver about to leave, Mrs Whittle got out of the car and stood in the space to keep it while her husband drove in. As he slowly began to manoeuvre his car, Ms McMillan got out of the passenger seat of a Land-Rover and stood in front of Mr Whittle's car. Mr McConnachie added: "She put her hands on the bonnet and attempted to stop him entering the space. Mrs Whittle made a comment to the effect that she and her husband were there first. Ms McMillan turned and grabbed her by the hair and kicked her face three times." Judge Lady Dorian deferred sentence for background reports.
