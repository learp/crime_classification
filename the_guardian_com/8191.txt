The Police Federation says it has called in detectives to investigate possible fraud within the organisation.The federation, which represents most of the 125,000 police officers in England and Wales, has been mired in controversy for years over how it handles money and the government has threatened to take it over if it does not reform.In a statement, the federation said it had called in police on Tuesday “to investigate potential fraudulent activity, relating to accounts held by the federation’s constables’ central committee”.A spokesperson confirmed that Will Riches had resigned as vice-chair of the federation on Wednesday, but would not say why. Riches remains in his other posts, including on the federation’s interim national board and on the powerful constables’ central committee, where he serves as a representative for the Metropolitan and City of London forces.Detectives from the Surrey force have been called into the body’s headquarters in Leatherhead to see if any criminal offences have been committed.The federation said: “The issue was identified by the PFEW itself and we are fully cooperating with their initial investigation, which is being undertaken to determine whether any offences have been committed. Until those inquiries are complete it would be inappropriate to comment further.”In a statement, Surrey police confirmed it was conducting the investigation into potential fraud. “Officers are currently carrying out inquiries to determine whether any offences have been committed and inquiries remain ongoing. Further updates will be issued in due course.”Riches has been a constable in the Met since 1995, starting his service in east London. He first won election to the constables’ central committee in 2009, and in 2014 he became vice-chair of the federation, losing out on being chair after a coin toss. The committee making the choice had split evenly, and Steve White, seen as a leading voice for modernising the organisation, was chosen after Riches called heads on a flipped 50p coin; it landed on tails.Riches did not return a request for comment.The federation has previously faced allegations of bullying and secret multimillion-pound bank accounts. Its relationship with the Conservative party was poisoned by the Plebgate affair involving the former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell.An independent review, chaired by Sir David Normington, following the scandal raised questions about the conduct of some of the federation’s former representatives, and found that officers were disenchanted with the body supposed to represent them.The federation was created by parliament in 1919 to represent rank-and-file officers and stop them joining unions with the right to strike.
