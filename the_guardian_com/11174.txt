A train passenger who became an internet sensation after he was filmed ejecting an alleged fare dodger from a train will not be prosecuted.Mobile phone footage of Alan Pollock, 35, from Stirling, intervening in a protracted row between a train conductor and Sam Main, 19, a student from Falkirk, on the Edinburgh to Perth train, was posted on YouTube and has been viewed more than 2m times.Main had been accused of not having the right ticket for the journey and was refusing to leave the train, which was being held at Linlithgow station. Pollock ejected Main from the train and was cheered by some of his fellow passengers, one of whom dubbed him the "Big Man". The incident was captured on mobile phone video and later uploaded to the internet.Pollock, a financial manager, was charged with assault following the incident, and Main was reported to prosecutors under section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing Act Scotland, which covers threatening and abusive behaviour.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Crown Office, the Scottish prosecution service, said there would be no criminal proceedings against either man.A Crown Office spokesperson said: "The procurator fiscal at Livingston received reports concerning two males aged 35 and 19 in connection with an incident in Linlithgow on Friday 9 December 2011. After full and careful consideration of the reports by crown counsel, it was decided that it is not in the public interest to prosecute either male, and the cases are now closed."
