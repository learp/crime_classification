A young Muslim bride was stabbed to death moments before her wedding in a plot hatched by two of her cousins, a court heard yesterday.Sahjda Bibi, 21, was getting ready for a controversial marriage to her boyfriend - who had been married before - when her cousin, Rafaqat Hussain, attacked her with a kitchen knife in her bedroom, stabbing her 22 times as she tried to fight him off, Birmingham crown court was told. He then ran out of the house, stabbing the groom and dropping the knife as he jumped into a BMW where his cousin, Tafarak Hussain, was waiting to help him escape. Tafarak Hussain, of Bordesley, Birmingham, denies murder. Rafaqat Hussain, Camberley, Surrey, admitted murder at an earlier hearing. Rafaqat met Tafarak on the morning of the wedding, January 11, when they started to plan their attack, said Tim Raggatt QC, for the prosecution. They arranged for a plane ticket so that Rafaqat could flee to Pakistan the same afternoon and also made plans for a taxi to take him to Heathrow airport. Then Tafarak is thought to have driven his cousin to the house in Alum Rock, Birmingham, where the celebrations were expected to start. Mr Raggatt told the court: "At about 1.45 on the afternoon of January 11, Sahjda Bibi, aged just 21, was upstairs in the bedroom at the front of her house, getting ready to be married. "In a few moments, what in other circumstances, might have been a very happy day, was shattered - shattered in a most brutal fashion because as she was in that room preparing for her marriage, Sahjda Bibi was murdered." Rafaqat then left the house as family members desperately tried to hold him back and he jumped into the waiting BMW. Mr Raggatt said: "Tafarak's assistance to Rafaqat was absolutely vital. He realised what he was doing assisting Rafaqat to carry out the plan." The trial continues today.
