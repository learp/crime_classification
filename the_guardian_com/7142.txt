Three boys appeared in court today charged with the murder of father-of-three Garry Newlove.Mr Newlove, 47, was attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, on Friday night after a confrontation with a gang of youths who were vandalising a vehicle. He died in hospital on Sunday.Today, three youths - two aged 15 and a third aged 16 - appeared at Runcorn youth court.The boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, spoke only to confirm their names and addresses.Joanne Parsons, prosecuting, told the court Mr Newlove died from a haemorrhage caused by a hard blow near his left ear.Roger Allanson, defending the 15-year-olds, said they both denied the charge.All three were remanded into local authority secure accommodation to appear at Warrington magistrates court on August 20.An application for bail for the 15-year-olds was refused and there was no application for bail for the 16-year-old.Chairman of the bench, Quentin Greenwood, used his discretion to allowed Mr Newlove's family to sit in the youth court, which is usually closed to the public.He did so despite an objection from Mr Allanson, who said the hearing was intimidating enough.Expressing his condolences to the family, Mr Allanson said: "I understand their wish to hear what's being said of the deceased and the circumstances surrounding his death."But it is a youth court. Reasons for excluding the public are valid to protect the identification of youngsters who are before the courts."These are people who have only been accused."Three other youths who were arrested have been released and an 18-year-old continues to help police with their enquiries.
