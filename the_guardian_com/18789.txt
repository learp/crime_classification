An aspiring doctor who was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack last week gained top grades in his GCSE results, his school has revealed.Ajmol Alom, 16, who was described by his headteacher as "one of our brightest prospects", achieved eight A grades including maths, science, English literature, geography, religious studies and citizenship; and three B grades.Chris Dunne, his headteacher, said the grades would have made Ajmol's hopes of a career in medicine "a very real possibility".He said: "All the many journalists who interviewed me after the horrifying event of his murder wanted to know how 'good' he was as a student."I was able to say without hesitation that he was very able, looking forward to GCSE results at a very high level and very capable of going on to achieve the kind of grades which would have secured him a place at any one of our best universities."Ajmol would always have been the last person to boast of his abilities."He regularly attended the extra classes and revision sessions run by his teachers, even when he probably didn't need their help any longer. His friends could rely on him for help if they needed it, not for arrogance or scorn."Friends gathered at Langdon Park school in east London – within sight of the scene where Ajmol was attacked – to collect their GCSE results on Thursday morning. The teenagers said they always knew Ajmol would achieve top grades.Tareque Alom, 16, recalled how his friend used to help him with maths work. "He was humble, he was never arrogant with all his grades and was always willing to help others who didn't understand," he said."He was a really sociable person as well. He set the benchmark for all of us, he was a role model for all of us."Tareque said he had been to see Ajmol's parents, who were pleased with his results.
