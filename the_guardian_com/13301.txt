The Georgian billionaire who collapsed and died at his Surrey mansion on Tuesday was suffering from severe heart disease, an inquest heard today.A coroner was told the health of 52-year-old Badri Patarkatsishvili was such that he could have died "at any time". Postmortem tests have already found that he probably died of natural causes.Surrey police brought in a large team of detectives to investigate the death because Patarkatsishvili had claimed he was the target of an assassination plot. However, Woking coroner's court was told today that a report by pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl had found that Patarkatsishvili suffered from coronary heart disease. He said: "This was of a severity that could have resulted in a sudden and unexplained collapse and death at any time." Fegan-Earl concluded that the chest pains Patarkatsishvili complained of and his subsequent collapse were consistent with dying from coronary heart disease. The court heard tests indicated no evidence of any radioactive or nuclear presence in his body. Police concerns were heightened because – like the poisoned former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko – Patarkatsishvili was an associate of Boris Berezovsky, the British-based Russian multimillionaire whom Moscow has repeatedly tried and failed to extradite to face trial on a number of charges.Patarkatsishvili decided to run for Georgian president last year but was secretly video-recorded during a meeting in which he appeared to offer an enormous bribe to a government official who was offering to orchestrate a coup. He subsequently claimed he had evidence that government officials were attempting to hire Chechen gangsters to kill him in Britain.
