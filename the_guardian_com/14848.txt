Amid growing political and media calls for water cannon to be deployed on the streets of mainland Britain for the first time to quell urban rioters, support for their use has come from both sides of the political divide.However, some have raised doubts about the practicality of such a move.Patrick Mercer, a Conservative MP and former army officer, told the BBC Today programme: "In Northern Ireland just a few weeks ago, we had very serious riots including the use of firearms, where water cannon and plastic rounds, not lethal weapons, were used without anyone batting an eyelid."I am not saying that is necessarily what we want, but we have got to allow the police to use their powers and, once they have arrested individuals, for the judiciary to be able to punish them."They should have the tools available, and they should use them if the commander on the ground thinks it is necessary. I don't think we have necessarily to mollycoddle Englishmen because we don't molycoddle Irishmen."Mercer described the use of water cannon in Northern Ireland, in his experience, as extremely effective. Ken Livingstone, the former Labour mayor of London, also suggested water cannon could be very useful.The high-pressure hoses, which fire jets of water or vapour, have been used in Northern Ireland since 2001.They are used by police in parts of Europe, including Belgium and France, to tackle riots, and have been used in the US. The technology is understood to have been first used in Germany in the 1930s.Theresa May, the home secretary, has played down calls for the use of water cannon, although David Cameron insisted "everything necessary to restore order in Britain's streets" would be considered.Last year, May said the government would look at all options – although use of water cannon would be a police operational decision – before backtracking in the Commons and telling MPs: "I don't think anybody wants to see water cannon used ... because we have a different attitude to the culture of policing here".The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has six white-painted water cannon. Some were used against rioters in the Ardoyne area of Belfast last month, where one was disabled when its tyres were punctured.A spokesman for the PSNI said no request for information, advice or the loan of equipment had been received from the Metropolitan police.Doubts were expressed about whether police, or troops, would have sufficient training to use water cannon at short notice. Although the technology is similar to that of fire engines, fire service personnel receive weeks of training in the use of their equipment, and they are not using it against people.A spokesman for Angloco, a Batley-based manufacturer of firefighting equipment, said the company did not make or supply water cannon. "The technology would be similar, but you would need training and the ability to keep personnel safe. Using them could be lethal," he added.Water cannon generally have reservoirs of 8,000 litres of water and are can deliver jets of up to 1,100 litres a minute, capable of knocking someone over at up to 100 yards.There are doubts about how viable water cannon would be in London. Obtaining water supplies may be difficult in riots, and there is a risk of internal injuries to demonstrators.The terms under which water cannon might be used, and who would authorise their deployment, would also need to be clarified. Both the users and the authorisers would probably require training in such circumstances.Mike Ritchie, the director of the committee on the administration of justice in Northern Ireland, voiced concerns arising from the use of plastic bullets or baton rounds in the province, where about 20 people have been killed during the 30 years of the Troubles, usually when rounds have been fired at close range.He said: "Water cannon were not really used during the Troubles but they have been used more since and have not really provoked as many complaints. No one has been injured or killed, and they seem to have been less problematic."
