Residents of high-crime housing estates, youth workers, teachers and housing managers should be trained to tackle anti-social behaviour as part of a "Big Society" drive, according to a report published today.The report says the approach, which echoes David Cameron's general election rhetoric, could be adopted in the face of spending cuts and a potential reduction in police officer numbers.The Royal Society of Arts report says Britain is seen as having one of the worst antisocial behaviour problems in Europe, and that its citizens are far less likely to intervene to tackle problems than their continental peers.The report by Ben Rogers, an RSA visiting fellow and former Downing Street policy strategist, says that while 60% of the German public say they feel confident in tackling antisocial behaviour, such as young teenagers vandalising bus stops, this confidence falls to 30% in Britain.Rogers says New Labour's almost obsessive "top-down" approach to tackling low-level crime and disorder, which involved investing heavily in neighbourhood policing and issuing antisocial behaviour orders, had only limited success. This is borne out, he says, by a recent survey of antisocial behaviour across six western European countries which found the UK was regarded as having the most serious problem. However, the report does concede that this outlook could have more to do with media coverage than direct experience.The report – The Woolwich Model: how citizens can tackle antisocial behaviour – says the disappearance of such people as caretakers and park-keepers, a growing uncertainty over the rules about admonishing other people's children, and a belief that the system is weighted against those who "take a stand", have led to a public retreat from day-to-day intervention.The report, which suggests ministers look to public-service workers, volunteers and residents to play a more active role in local policing, draws on a model developed in the 1870s by the early pioneers of first aid in Woolwich, south London. The idea is for the introduction of courses in community safety skills focusing on aspects such as self protection and restraint, "reading" a situation and defusing it.Teaching self-defence skills could make some liberals uneasy, Rogers says but adds that those abilities are important in giving people the confidence to intervene.Rogers, who is an associate fellow of the Institute of Public Policy Research and of Demos, acknowledges that this approach might be seen as a vigilante's charter but says that community safety training would ensure those involved acted responsibly within the law. "If this training becomes at all widespread it would help make expectations and standards more explicit, so making it easier to draw a line between appropriate and inappropriate behaviour in tackling crime and disorder."He added that though it was right for the police to deal with obviously criminal types of antisocial behaviour, such as drug dealing, there was still significant scope for the public to intervene in less serious situations.
