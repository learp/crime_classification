A 12-year-old boy was among eight suspected illegal migrants rescued from a chemical tanker after suffering breathing problems, police said last nightThe eight people, thought to be from Eritrea, were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences after receiving hospital treatment, Scotland Yard said.The 55-year-old driver of a German-registered tanker stopped in south-east London was earlier arrested on suspicion of people trafficking.Workers laying water pipes reported hearing banging from inside the tank and witnesses said they spoke to the driver before raising the alarm.Two children - boys aged 12 and 16 - were found inside, along with five adult men and one woman. They were discovered limp and covered in a black, sooty substance, when the driver apparently stopped to check his load.Scotland Yard said the group were suffering breathing difficulties as a result of gas created by the load, a powdered carbon-based chemical. None was thought to be have been badly affected but all were taken to hospital as a precaution.Police closed part of the dual carriageway in Bexley while fire brigade and ambulance hazard specialists responded to what was described as a potentially dangerous chemical incident. A police spokesman said: "London ambulance service have taken all eight to hospital. A 100-metre cordon has been put up while London fire brigade check the tanker."The London ambulance service said a specialist unit, known as a hazardous area response team, had been sent to the scene with an air ambulance, four ambulances and a fast response car.The tanker is owned by H Freund, a German road haulage company with offices in Frechen, Germany, and Runcorn, Cheshire. According to its website, the firm specialises in storing and transporting chemical products. The company said it was liaising with the Metropolitan police over the circumstances of the incident.One witness said there was a strong chemical smell, similar to that created by fuel briquettes used on barbecues.Pete Hobbs and his son, also Pete, were among those who saw the apparent stowaways being taken out of the tanker.Hobbs Jnr, 19, watched as the occupants were taken through a hatch in the top of the tank before being treated at the roadside. His father, 40, from Chatham, Kent, said: "All you could hear was banging on the side of the tank. The other lads stopped the lorry driver and said 'we can hear banging'."The Border and Immigration Agency said it was investigating the incident.If a vehicle is found to have clandestine passengers, the driver, employer, owner or hirer may be liable for a penalty of up to Â£2,000 for each person carried. If there is evidence a driver - or another party - knew about the illegal migrants they could face prosecution.The Home Office said: "There will inevitably be some occasions when illegal entrants manage to penetrate our borders unlawfully, and some do so in lorries."But our deployment of state-of-the-art detection technology, the levying of civil penalties on hauliers, and closer co-operation with carriers, port authorities and EU counterparts are clamping down on clandestine entry into the UK."
