Interior designers have finally got their hands on Britain's prisons as will be shown when the first purpose-built women's jail for 30 years opens next week in west London.The privately run Bronzefield women's prison at Ashford in Middlesex features an attractive beige and fuschia colour scheme devised to give a "less intimidating and a more domestic feel" than is found in many male prisons.The Â£200m-plus prison run by United Kingdom Detention Services on a 25-year contract will be the 10th private prison in England and Wales and will receive the first of its 450 inmates next Monday.The new jail includes three two-storey houseblocks and a mother and baby unit which can house up to 12 women and their children. Its first residents will be moved from Holloway prison in north London, where the mother and baby unit is to refurbished.Bronzefield is built on the site of the former Ashford remand centre and is the first purpose- built women's jail since the Victorian Holloway was completely rebuilt in the 1970s. The women's prison population in England and Wales has more than doubled from 1,810 in 1994 to more than 4,500.The number of prisons with "female units" has risen over the same period from 12 to 19. Bronzefield is designed to take some of the pressure off Holloway but it will still have to take women from as far afield as Leicester until a third UKDS private prison is opened next year in Peterborough.But while the rest of the women's prisons in England and Wales have to cope with the difficulties caused by overcrowding, the new private prison will remain relatively uncrowded. The Home Office contract specifies that it should never have a population that is more than 10% above its 450 capacity - a distinct advantage compared with many state prisons.The Prison Reform Trust last night criticised the decision to open a new women's jail, predicting it "would be as ineffective as opening another lane to the M25" and claimed it signalled a defeat for the government's policy of tackling women offenders in the community.Bronzefield's new director is Janine McDowell, the former deputy governor of nearby Feltham young offenders institution. "The prison has been very much designed with women prisoners in mind and their needs," she said yesterday."It has been designed to be as least oppressive as possible and as attractive as it can be."There is a prayer facility for Muslim prisoners, a healthcare centre and gym, and special efforts have been made to try to prevent self-harm and suicides.
