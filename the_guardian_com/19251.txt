A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 10-year-old girl found dead in woodland near her home.Greater Manchester police said they had arrested an 18-year-old from Leigh. He is being questioned over the murder of Lauren Pilkington-Smith, who was found in woods near Twist Lane, Leigh, on Friday. A post-mortem examination revealed she died from multiple blows to her head. She had been playing cricket with friends on Thursday afternoon from around 4.30pm. Police said she had called home regularly and was last seen by her parents at around 7pm. Police said she had been subjected to a brutal attack. Three people were arrested earlier in the week, but they have been released without charge. The 18-year-old was arrested at 8am, and was being questioned at Pendleton police station in Salford. Yesterday, a blanket of floral tributes covered the area near where the child's body was found, near the Leeds-Liverpool canal. Her parents said: "Lauren was a beautiful, lively little girl and the family has been left devastated by what has happened. Our world has collapsed and we can't even begin to think about what we will do without her. "Lauren was a tomboy who loved playing out and everyone around here adored her. We don't know how we can come to terms with this." Police are also trying to trace the driver of a large gold-coloured saloon car, who may have been walking his dog in the area when Lauren was last seen alive. It is believed he had fishing equipment in his car.
