A man who imprisoned his wife in their home and expected her to be a servant cannot be allowed to see his two daughters, senior judges have ruled.The woman and the children – aged six and eight – had left the home with the help of police after begging a teacher at their school for help, the court of appeal heard.She had been told the children could live with her, and a judge had ruled the father should not be allowed direct contact with the girls, following a county court hearing in Chelmsford, Essex.Three appeal court judges yesterday upheld that ruling by judge John Holt.They said an order preventing a man from having direct contact was exceptional. But they said the welfare of the two girls demanded it.No-one was identified in a written ruling by Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lady Justice King, who analysed the case at an appeal hearing in London in November, but judges indicated that the man was Punjabi.Judges heard the woman had asked relatives for help, but they were “ingrained in the culture”, did not want the “shame of a failed marriage” and had told her to “submit”.Police thought she was at “high risk” of being the victim of an “honour-based killing” and prosecutors had charged the man with false imprisonment.But the woman had been unable to continue giving evidence, and a criminal trial had been halted and the man acquitted.Judge Holt had then been asked to make decisions about the future of the children after civil court litigation began.He concluded that the woman had been held against her will.He said the man had expected his wife to “be a servant” and “provide him with babies”.The judge had heard that a cousin of the woman had been the victim of an “honour” killing 30 years ago after leaving her husband, and concluded the man knew of that murder and had used it as a means of “controlling” his wife. He ruled the children were at “serious risk of kidnap” if their father found out where they were, and the woman at “serious risk of harm”.
