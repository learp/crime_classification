A businessman from one of Britain's richest families is due to be charged today with making a corrupt payment to Saddam Hussein's regime.David Mabey, 48, is accused with two others of breaking United Nations sanctions on Iraq and of dishonestly falsifying an invoice to hide the payment. They are scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates court.Mabey's family has made an estimated £200m from selling steel bridges around the world.The charges arise from a three-year Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation into allegations that British business people paid kickbacks to Saddam's regime to win contracts. A UN investigation has alleged that more than 2,000 firms around the world broke sanctions imposed on the regime by making illicit payments.In a corporate prosecution brought by the SFO, the family firm, Mabey and Johnson, has previously been convicted of related corruption offences and ordered to pay a fine.The other two facing charges are the former Mabey and Johnson director Richard Forsyth, 61, and consultant Richard Gledhill, 63, of Watford, Hertfordshire.According to the charges lodged by prosecutors, the three men gave €422,000 euro to the Iraqi government via a Jordan National Bank account controlled by Upper Gulf Agencies between May 2001 and November 2002, contrary to UN sanctions.They are also accused of breaking the 1968 Theft Act by falsifying the invoice so the price of a components contract appeared to be €4,222,643 "whereas that figure was €422,264 more than the price actually agreed".
