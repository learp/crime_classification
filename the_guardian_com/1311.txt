A City lawyer who was stabbed to death yards from his home in north London had been enjoying the 'happiest time of his life', his family said yesterday. Tom ap Rhys Pryce, 31, was a 'unique and beautiful person' who was looking forward to marrying his fiancée, Adele Eastman, and starting a family.'Words cannot express our sense of loss and sadness at what has happened,' they added in a statement. 'He will be hugely missed by everyone who knew him.'Mr Pryce, who worked for the leading corporate law firm Linklaters, was attacked last Thursday night in Willesden, north west London, by two men who robbed him.His fiancée's father, Rod Eastman, launched an attack on Britain's 'lawless society', saying that ordinary people should arm themselves against attack from muggers.'If you value your life and want to protect yourself on the streets the only way is to carry a weapon,' he added.
