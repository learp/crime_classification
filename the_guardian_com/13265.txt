Singer Amy Winehouse's husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, who was jailed in July for a "vicious" attack on a pub landlord while high on cocaine and alcohol, has lost an appeal against his sentence.Fielder-Civil, 26, of Camden, north London, was seeking to challenge the 27-month sentence he received. It was rejected by two judges at the appeal court in London.Winehouse has spoken publicly about her agony at being separated from her troubled husband.Fielder-Civil's trial at Snaresbrook crown court heard how he and a friend, Michael Brown, carried out a "vicious and one-sided" assault on James King, 36, landlord of a pub in Hoxton, east London, in June 2006.King was beaten so badly that he needed plates fitted into his face for a broken cheekbone.In an attempt to escape justice, Fielder-Civil and Brown plotted to bribe King with Â£200,000 not to testify.Fielder-Civil was released from prison earlier this month on condition that he resides at a drug rehabilitation centre. Dismissing the appeal for full release, Mr Justice Pitchford told Fielder-Civil to continue the progress he had made at the centre, suggesting it was the only way he would have a "worthwhile future".Fielder-Civil, who was in court, said after the hearing: "I am disappointed but not really surprised."
