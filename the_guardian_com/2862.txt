A former headteacher at a prestigious prep school has been convicted of child sex offences. Roland Peter Wright, 83, from Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, was accused of sexually assaulting five pupils aged eight to 13 at Caldicott Boys' preparatory school between 1959 and 1970.He was found guilty of 12 counts of sexual assault by a jury at Amersham crown court and will be sentenced on 6 February. His conviction comes after fellow former teachers John Addrison and Hugh Henry pleaded guilty to sex abuse, it can now be reported.DS Joe Banfield said: "I am delighted that the jury has found Roland Peter Wright guilty of 12 charges. This result would not have occurred without the support of the many victims and witnesses in this case, who bravely gave evidence and provided statements."Many of the victims and witnesses had to travel long distances to court, in some cases from different continents, in order to see justice served."Wright had previously been found not guilty of three offences at an earlier trial.Ruth Bowskill, of Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, paid tribute to the victims for their "strength and tenacity in coming forward and giving evidence".She said: "Roland Peter Wright was a particularly trusted member of staff at Caldicott school and became the head teacher. Not only did he breach the trust of the pupils at the school, their parents and the staff, Wright also abused his position of authority in order to gain access to his victims."Roland Peter Wright has never shown any contrition for his behaviour or apologised for his conduct. At all times he has sought to evade responsibility for what he did."
