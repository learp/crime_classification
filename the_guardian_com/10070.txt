The two most expensive criminal and civil cases which were wound up in 2004-05 cost taxpayers more than £28m in legal aid. The most costly criminal case clocked up legal aid fees of £18.4m, while the bill for the most expensive civil case was just short of £10m.The figures, outlined in a letter to the Labour MP Andrew Dismore from the constitutional affairs minister Harriet Harman, highlighted the costs to public funds of just a few expensive cases.The criminal case, Operation Blossom, a prosecution of six men on charges of international software piracy, ended with convictions and prison sentences of up to two and a half years. Prosecution costs of £750,000 must be added to the £18.4m legal aid payments to the defence team, producing a cost of more than £19m.The most expensive civil case closed in 2004-05, which cost £9.9m in legal aid, was a failed group action on behalf of 120 women who died or suffered strokes after taking third-generation contraceptive pills. The lead counsel for the women, Daniel Brennan QC, was the highest earner from civil legal aid in 2002-03, receiving £606,000, mainly from that case.Fifteen barristers were paid for working on the piracy case. Their full fees are not stated but three received brief fees of £450,000 or more for preparing the case.Six firms of solicitors were paid a total of more than £14m. The highest paid barrister was James Sturman QC, who received £1.18m, mainly for that case, in 2004-05, making him the first barrister to be paid more than £1m in a single year from criminal legal aid. His client pleaded guilty and never stood trial. Since 2004 a new system has given the Legal Services Commission, which administers legal aid, more control over spending. Under the system lawyers are paid only for work agreed in advance with the commission rather than claiming arrears.
