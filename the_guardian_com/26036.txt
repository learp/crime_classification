Fears are growing that there is an orchestrated campaign of attacks on premises owned by Ireland's one-time richest man, but now bankrupt, Sean Quinn.The Quinn Group's headquarters in Northern Ireland was vandalised on Wednesday night after a truck was driven into a wall. The wall was demolished near the staff canteen at Derrylin although no one was injured in the attack.The Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Síochána have launched a joint investigation into this latest attack.The canteen is opposite the headquarters of the Quinn Group in Co Fermanagh and just across the border from Ballyconnell in Co Cavan.The area has been sealed off by the PSNI while investigations continue. Over recent months there have been numerous attacks on Quinn Group property.Vehicles have been burned and power lines cut to businesses in the group, while last August two cars at the Co Meath home of the company's head were set on fire.Sean Quinn is currently embroiled in a court battle with the former Anglo Irish Bank over billions of euros the bank says he owes after taking loans out with it.Quinn was once believed to have been worth €4.72bn (£3.7bn).He lost control of his manufacturing and insurance business empire in April. Since then, there have been a series of attacks on Quinn Group properties.Quinn has since declared himself bankrupt in Northern Ireland, which means he can go back into business within 12 months – a move being challenged by the former Anglo Irish Bank at Belfast high court.
