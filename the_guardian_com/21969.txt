Police have apologised for taking a 12-year-old boy out of lessons last week to question him about a planned picket outside David Cameron's constituency office.Nicky Wishart, a pupil at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, organised the protest in an attempt to save his youth club and 20 others in the area from closure in March, a consequence of Â£4.2m of cuts in Oxfordshire county council's youth services budget.Wishart set up a Facebook page with a 13-year-old friend to advertise the protest. It attracted more than 130 people, mainly children and young teenagers from surrounding youth clubs in the Witney area, where Cameron is the local MP.Five days before the peaceful picket, the school was contacted by anti-terrorist police after they saw the page, according to Wishart's mother, Virginia Phelps.Chief inspector Jack Malhi, Thames Valley police's local area commander for West Oxfordshire, said: "With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been far more appropriate to have made the inquiries from Nicky in the presence of his mother. I deeply regret and apologise for the impact that it might have had on Nicky and his family. I would like to reassure people that our contact with Nicky was primarily to make him aware of the risks and have an idea of the scale of the protest."Despite the threat of arrest, Wishart went ahead with the protest last Friday. At the protest, he said: "The youth centre means loads to me. It's the only thing we have to do in Eynsham."His mother said of the apology: "I really appreciate it because that's what you want. It can't be left up in the air. He [Malhi] phoned me and has invited me and Nicky to go and have a cup of tea with him. He went through everything and he was a really nice guy."The headteacher of Bartholomew school, Andrew Hamilton, also apologised to the family for the incident.
