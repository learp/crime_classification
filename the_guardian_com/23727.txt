Police last night named the victim of a "brazen and targeted" gang attack, in which a man was ambushed and rammed by two cars as he drove away from a football game at a leisure centre.Detectives believe Qudir Ahmed, 24, was singled out in a revenge attack after an argument, or in drugs-related violence which has plagued Keighley, West Yorkshire. He and a friend leapt from their hatchback after it was first clipped by one of the attackers' cars and then smashed across the road by the second. The friend escaped but Mr Ahmed was chased for 100 yards down the road by four or more youths. He was then beaten to death on a roundabout, still busy with traffic at 11pm, in what Det Supt Phil Sedgwick described as a savage attack. One of the attackers is believed to have used a carjack or other blunt instrument. Mr Sedgwick said that Mr Ahmed's friend was still too shocked to give details. Local people spoke of gang warfare in the town, most of it thought to be drugs-related. Police did not believe the attack was racially motivated and ruled out the attack as an attempted carjacking. Mr Sedgwick said: "All the early indications are that this was a targeted attack on either the man who died or his friend." Neither Mr Ahmed nor his friend, who has not been named but is in his 20s, is known to have been involved in crime. "It is possible it was people who were playing football with him," said Mr Sedgwick. "They may have had an argument or fallen out." Keighley saw a couple of similar gang murders shortly before Christmas.
