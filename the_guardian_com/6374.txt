The maverick police commander behind Scotland Yard's cannabis experiment admitted yesterday that he was "very disappointed" to be forced out of his post but conceded that the move was inevitable following allegations of drug-taking published in a Sunday tabloid newspaper.Though the metropolitan police authority (MPA) acted swiftly yesterday to move Brian Paddick from his job as borough commander in Lambeth, south London, until an outside force completes an inquiry, the door has been left open for him to return. The MPA said it was uneasy about the way that chequebook journalism had been behind the claims in the Mail on Sunday, which reportedly paid a former boyfriend of Mr Paddick's Â£100,000 for details of their relationship. The MPA's chairman, Lord Harris, praised Mr Paddick as a man of "enormous talents". But the MPA was left with few options once the claims of the former model James Renolleau appeared. He alleged that Mr Paddick had smoked 100 cannabis joints with him at the home they shared in Westminster. Mr Paddick has strongly denied the claims and said that Mr Renolleau, 36, is embittered about the break-up of their relationship. Even if the police complaints authority rules that there is nothing to substantiate Mr Renolleau's story, it could demand disciplinary charges against Mr Paddick on two other matters. Mr Paddick admitted he had seen Mr Renolleau smoke cannabis joints at their home, and that he suspected small amounts of cannabis were stored there. He also failed to tell senior officers that Mr Renolleau was on bail for an offence at the time their relationship started in 1995. Lord Harris admitted yesterday that Mr Paddick could face the sack if all the allegations were proved true. Mr Paddick said yesterday: "Obviously, I'm very disappointed to be leaving Lambeth, albeit temporarily." He is to work at Scotland Yard's headquarters with deputy assistant commissioner Tim Godwin.
