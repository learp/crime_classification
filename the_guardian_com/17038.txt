Ulster's prison service is set to sack five officers if allegations that they had sex with inmates at the top-security Maghaberry jail prove to be well-founded.An internal investigation has been launched into alleged "inappropriate behaviour" by male officers with two female convicted murderers, and by a female officer with a convicted Protestant paramilitary. Last week prison chiefs sent letters to the five officers. The five had been suspended after the allegations surfaced last month. The officers can appeal against the decision to dismiss them before any final decision is made. Prison chiefs have called in a retired detective superintendent to carry out an investigation, which is expected to take several months. The prison service said it would not comment on individual personnel matters. But a spokesman added: "The service has a code of conduct and discipline which sets out the high standards of personal conduct expected by staff both on and off duty." The statement stressed that the vast majority of staff carried out their duties to the high standards expected and with the utmost integrity. "The prison service will rigorously investigate any allegations of misconduct and will not hesitate to take appropriate action if required." The two women inmates involved in the allegations were jailed for murdering their husbands. A female officer is alleged to have slept with a former senior member of the Loyalist Volunteer Force.
