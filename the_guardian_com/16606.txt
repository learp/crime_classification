I welcome any contribution to the important debate prompted by our plans to reconfigure the police service to ensure it is best equipped to deal with the demands of 21st-century crime-fighting (The craving for control that Blair once knew was wrong, December 21). However, I cannot allow some of Simon Jenkins's wilder assertions to go unchallenged.I can assure him the government has no secret regional agenda. Nor are we plotting to centralise policing or using the current restructuring process as a stepping stone towards a smaller number of forces in the future. There is no blueprint other than to ensure we end up with strategic forces of sufficient size to deliver both effective neighbourhood policing and to combat serious organised crime and terrorism, as HM Inspectorate of Constabulary recommended.And far from having "collapsed", beat policing is an absolute cornerstone of our police reforms. By 2008 every neighbourhood will have a dedicated team of officers. Every resident will know the name of their local bobby, see them on the street and will have their phone number and email. Nor will we see an end to local accountability. Quite the opposite. We will be exploring how to boost accountability arrangements at local basic command unit level to ensure communities have a genuine and strong voice in setting policing priorities and triggering action.Above that, the chief constable will lead a strategic force capable of addressing organised crime and other cross-regional issues. This will feed into and spur action by the partner organisations, such as the new Serious Organised Crime Agency, which tackles national and international crime bosses.
