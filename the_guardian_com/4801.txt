Police today said they had begun a review of the Lockerbie bombing case focusing solely on searching for any new evidence pointing to the accomplices of the only man convicted of the atrocity.The British families of the bereaved reacted to the news with a mix of cautious optimism and suspicion. A total of 270 people died when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over the town of Lockerbie in December 1988.An email sent to some of the bereaved families says police and prosecutors in the Crown Office are pursuing "several potential lines of inquiry". The email was sent by Lindsey Miller, a senior procurator fiscal at the Crown Office, on 3 September this year.Scottish authorities today said any review would not examine the guilt or innocence of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the Libyan intelligence agent convicted of the bombing. He was released in August on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government after dropping his appeal against conviction.Police denied that any new investigation had been launched, and stressed that other reviews of the case had taken place during the past 21 years.The email was a response from the Scottish authorities to questions about the case from some of the families of victims.Under the heading: "re proactive efforts continuing to try to obtain new information and evidence?", Miller writes: "In short the answer to this is "yes". Throughout the investigation we have, at various times, taken stock of the evidence as a whole, with a view to identifying further lines of inquiry that can be pursued."Now that the appeal proceedings are at an end, a further review of the case is under way and several potential lines of inquiry, both through a 'desktop' (paper) exercise and consultation with forensic science colleagues are being considered."The email says the criminal investigation into Lockerbie continues, with four detectives working on it full time, under the direction of the Crown Office.John Mosey, whose daughter was killed in the bombing, was sceptical and said: "This move by the Crown Office is a damage limitation effort." He said forensic evidence of interest that could be re-examined included a thumbnail-size piece of circuit board that the crown said came from the bomb.Mosey said that Mohammed Abu Talb, a Palestinian suspect in the bombing, had last week been freed from a Swedish prison after serving a sentence for involvement in other terrorist attacks.In Edinburgh, the Crown Office tried to stop too much being read into news of a review of evidence. A spokesperson said: "There is no question of reopening the case against Megrahi. The open case concerns only the involvement of others with Megrahi in the murder of 270 people and the crown will continue to pursue such lines of inquiry that become available. The trial court accepted the crown's position that Mr Megrahi acted in furtherance of the Libyan intelligence services and did not act alone."Dumfries and Galloway Police Chief Constable Patrick Shearer: "Throughout the investigation we have at various times conducted reviews of the evidence as a whole in an attempt to identify further lines of inquiry that may be explored."Now that Mr Megrahi has decided to abandon his appeal against conviction a further review of the case is under way in respect of others who acted with him in the murder of 270 people."Reports of the police investigation being relaunched are inaccurate."The families of the bereaved want a public inquiry to be held to try and deal with a host of unanswered questions.Pamela Dix, who lost her brother Peter in the bombing, said: "Expectations around Megrahi's appeal were really quite high but hopes were profoundly dashed when the appeal was abandoned."The situation is unresolved and it is unfinished business."Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora, said: "I think that if they are really going to a meaningful investigation then that is all well and good and long overdue. I would be all for it."But if it is just a dodge to prevent an investigation into why the lives of those killed were not protected then I would be livid."A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government would welcome a wide-ranging inquiry into the circumstances of the Lockerbie atrocity, and we stand ready to assist in any way we can."Given the international dimensions to this issue, the remit of any such inquiry goes well beyond the restricted remit and responsibilities of the Scottish government or Scottish parliament, and would therefore have to be convened by those with the required powers."The foreign secretary, David Miliband, however, seemed to suggest an inquiry was a matter for the Scottish government: "This was something that happened over Scottish soil and it was investigated by Scottish authorities," he said. "It is right that they pursue the investigation on a criminal basis and if there is any suggestion of an inquiry, that should be a matter for the Scots, because that's the way that our system works." "You can see from today's announcement that the commitment in Scotland remains real in respect of justice in this case and that has to be right."
