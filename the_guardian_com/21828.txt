A jealous boyfriend who murdered his girlfriend after rowing over her three-year-old son's christening has been jailed for life.Liam King, 26, stabbed 24-year-old Rebecca Ayres 11 times with a knife in a "ferocious" attack, then fled the house they shared in Salford, Greater Manchester.King, described as "controlling, abusive and violent", became jealous because Ayres had been in regular contact with Colin Farn, the father of her son, Riley, to arrange the christening, Manchester crown court heard.Ayres had told King if he did not attend her son's christening on 9 March, their relationship was over.But on 5 March King, in a "sudden outburst of violence", attacked the young mother at their home in Salford.They had been in a relationship for just 18 months but friends had noticed bruising and marks on Ayres's face and body – said to have been inflicted by King – who pleaded guilty to her murder on Tuesday.Judge David Stockdale told him: "She had reported to them numerous instances of violence and if those accounts are right, you were a jealous, controlling, abusive and violent man towards her."This was a ferocious, sustained and repeated attack with a knife, causing 11 stab wounds and causing Rebecca Ayres's violent and tragic death."She lost her life, her son lost his mother, Rebecca Ayres has been lost to her parents and many friends."Judge Stockdale gave King a mandatory life sentence and ordered he serve a minimum of 15 years before being considered for parole.Ayres's son, Riley, was not at the address at the time of the murder.Earlier Mark Kellet, prosecuting, told the court that while Riley lived mostly with his mother, he had regular contact with his father when he was on leave from his job as a merchant seaman.As the christening loomed contact increased, sparking jealousy from King, the court heard.At around 10.30pm on 5 March, the couple's neighbour was awoken by an argument next door.She could hear Ayres pleading: "Get away from me, get off me, don't touch me."

There were also wounds to her hand and forearm as she tried to fight off her attacker. Ayres was pronounced dead at the scene.Police also found cord and a noose where King had apparently planned to hang himself but had passed out after drinking whiskey.King, who had three previous convictions for violence, was arrested later that morning after telephoning his mother to say: "I'm sorry, mum, I've killed Becky. I shouldn't be alive. I should've hanged myself."Questioned by detectives, King said: "I'm sorry for what I have done, sorry is not enough, I know that. Whatever they hand to me I will take it."Neil Flewitt QC, mitigating, asked the judge to accept the defendant's remorse was genuine and that the couple were in a "tempestuous" relationship.Flewitt added: "There was a great deal of tension created around Riley's christening."It's obvious from the text messages that Rebecca wanted him to attend and he did not want to be there."There was a good deal of tension illustrated by those text messages, building up, over the days ahead of her death and coming to a head on the night of her death."He's committed a very severe and inexcusable attack on Rebecca Ayres."
