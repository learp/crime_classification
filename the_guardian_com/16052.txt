The home secretary, David Blunkett, has called for the behaviour of nursery school children to be monitored to identify those likely to become the criminals of tomorrow.In his first major speech on the family since becoming the home secretary, Mr Blunkett told a parenting conference that measures must be taken to spot problem children as young as three who could eventually join gangs and cause misery in their neighbourhoods. Speaking today at the ParentChild 2002 conference in Islington, north London, he told delegates that the earlier unruly youngsters were spotted, the earlier support services could intervene to prevent offending behaviour. "We have got to be able to pick up on the behavioural reactions of children very quickly, from the moment the child enters nursery education," he said."Instead of trying to pick up the pieces when things go wrong it makes a lot more sense to invest resources in prevention."The home secretary said that while governments wanted to avoid "hectoring" parents on how to bring up their children it was crucial to intervene with dysfunctional families."The reality is that in many of our housing estates in many of our disadvantaged communities, a handful of those whose lifestyles and behaviour so disrupt the wellbeing of others are creating havoc," he said. "About half a dozen families may develop a style of behaviour where their children learn to be opinion formers in the gangs that are evident in our streets, where the lack of decent, acceptable role models leads them not to understand the difference between right and wrong." "We need not to pass the buck to the schools to do it, but to join together in the strength of the community to be able to provide that backing and that intervention early."We have got to provide support at the point where it can be most effective. Universal nursery provision makes that possible more quickly."Sometimes "moderate interventions" had no effect, said Mr Blunkett, implying that stronger measures may be necessary. The speech followed an announcement by the home secretary on Tuesday that persistent child offenders aged 10 and 11, who are legally too young be locked up, could be taken into the "protective custody" of a new breed of foster parents.Mr Blunkett also outlined plans to give the courts the power to lock up persistent young offenders aged 12 to 16 on remand while they await trial.
