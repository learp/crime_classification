About a quarter of UK adults are at risk of a growing telephone scam, known as vishing, in which they are tricked into revealing personal details to fraudsters claiming to be from a legitimate body such as their bank or the police.Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK) said it had seen a £36m increase over the past year in crimes involving online and phone banking, purchases made online and over the phone, and criminals filling out fraudulent applications.The body, which works to prevent fraud on behalf of the financial services industry, said at least £7m of this has been put down to vishing, the telephone equivalent of email scam phishing.Almost a quarter of people in the UK (23%) have received a cold call requesting personal or financial information, potentially meaning they could go on to become a victim of the scam.Four in 10 people (39%) admitted they found it challenging to tell the difference between a genuine and fraudulent call, FFA UK found.The body estimates that about one in 25 UK adults may have already been duped in such a con, and about four in 10 (43%) victims are estimated to be aged over 50.Vishing involves a fraudster posing on the phone as someone from a bank or building society fraud investigation team, the police or another legitimate organisation such as a telephone or internet provider.They attempt to get financial information, which often includes card and bank account details, pin numbers and personal details about the target such as their full name, date of birth and address. This information can then be used to plunder the victim's account or commit identity fraud.Conmen can also deceive the victim into transferring money from their bank account to one which is accessible to the fraudster. A variation on this scam involves the victim being persuaded to withdraw money from a branch or ATM to pay those behind the fraud.Almost a third (30%) of consumers were found to have received at least 10 cold calls a month, with two-fifths (41%) suspecting they had received a fraudulent or dubious call. Older people were much more likely to receive calls they felt were suspicious.The fraud prevention body said people should not be afraid to just put the phone down on someone if they are unsure about handing over details. It warned consumers not to assume a caller is genuine just because they hold some information about them. Criminals may already have got hold of some basic information about a potential victim, such as a name, address and bank account details, to make the call appear to be legitimate.Cold callers who suggest that you call them back to check authenticity can also keep your phone line open by not putting the phone down at their end.FFA UK is also warning consumers that their bank will never call up and ask for their four-digit card pin or ask them to withdraw money to hand over to them or transfer money to another account, even if they say it is in the consumer's name.Detective chief inspector Dave Carter, head of the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit, which is sponsored by the cards and banking industries, said: "Fraudsters can use personal information gleaned from vishing in a number of ways, including to access a victim's bank account, make fraudulent purchases and commit identity theft."Always be wary of cold callers who suggest you hang up the phone and call them back. Remember that it takes two people to terminate a call so try and use a different phone line if you are asked to ring back. If you think you've already been a victim of this scam, contact your bank or card company immediately."
