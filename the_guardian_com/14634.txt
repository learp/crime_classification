A bouncer was today found not guilty of raping a young woman at a top London nightclub.Vasil Makaveev, 28, denied forcing the woman to give him oral sex in the toilets of The Collection club in South Kensington in June this year. A jury at Kingston crown court cleared him of rape.The alleged victim, who cannot be named, claimed she had been "dumped" on the pavement outside the club "like a ragdoll" after the attack, which she claimed had left her in permanent pain.But giving evidence earlier in the week, Makaveev, a bodybuilder and former model from Bulgaria, said the sex was consensual.The Collection is a well known celebrity haunt, once voted "best scene restaurant" by the society magazine Tatler. Its website boasts that it attracts "A-List" guests such as Princes William and Harry, Angelina Jolie, Jay-Z and Elton John.George Michael held a birthday party there after being caught having sex in a public toilet, and the footballer Ashley Cole was arrested outside the club earlier this year for being drunk and disorderly.Lisa Wilding, prosecuting, said the woman, whose friends had left the club by the time of the alleged attack, was alone and vulnerable.She accused Makaveev of taking advantage of her during the incident, a charge he denied.Wilding said the woman was drunk, with alcohol levels later shown to be three-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit.Makaveev said he did not think the woman was drunk.He said that he thought the woman, who was a stranger, was dancing provocatively before they went to the toilets together.After they came out of the toilets, she was "very angry" and upset, and that it took four people to take her outside as she was "very powerful", he said.The alleged victim said she was "manhandled out of that club like a piece of meat", telling the court: "It was horrible, it really was, especially after I'd tried to make it known I had been attacked in the toilets and no one was listening to me."The jury heard that the woman and Makaveev went to the toilets to take cocaine together.She claims he forced her to perform a sexual act on him while they were in the cubicle, while he said he did nothing without her consent.
