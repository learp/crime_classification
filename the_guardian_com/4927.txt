The police complaints watchdog will supervise an investigation by Dorset police into the detention of an innocent commuter by armed officers.Dorset police stopped the man at gunpoint at Bournemouth train station on Saturday. Moments before, a British Transport police officer wrongly identified him as a suspect involved in an incident earlier in the day in Basingstoke, Hampshire.The case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) by Dorset police yesterday and the decision not to launch a full investigation followed within hours. The IPCC said it had decided "the actions of the force were appropriate and proportionate to the circumstances".However, questions remain over why the 21-year-old man, who is black, was first identified as a threat.The "supervised investigation" is expected to focus on the chain of communication that resulted in the 21-year-old being ordered to lie on the floor, arms outstretched, as two officers stood above him with handguns.It is understood that Hampshire police circulated a "description" of a man or group of men involved in an incident with an imitation firearm at Basingstoke shopping centre. A British Transport police officer identified the 21-year-old as a suspect on the basis of that information.Hampshire police, British Transport police and the IPCC all declined requests from theguardian.com for the description that led to the 21-year-old being wrongly identified as a threat. Dorset police were unavailable for comment."The IPCC has decided that Dorset police should also look at the full circumstances of this incident, including the information shared by the British Transport police and Hampshire constabulary," the IPCC said in a statement. "As the investigation will cover three police forces it will be carried out under the supervision of the IPCC."Photographs of the moment the 21-year-old was detained were published today, prompting comparisons with the case of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian man mistakenly shot dead by police after the failed July 21 bomb attacks.Witnesses said around 10 officers, some armed, had blocked off the exits as the train approached shortly after 6pm.A senior officer from Dorset police has since apologised to the 21-year-old, who lives in Bournemouth and is not believed to have made a formal complaint. His family has also been assigned a family liaison officer. Five men have been arrested and bailed over the incident in Basingstoke town centre on Saturday afternoon.
