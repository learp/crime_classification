A woman whose headless body was found floating in the River Thames had been stabbed to death, Scotland Yard said yesterday.The victim's hands were also missing when the clothed body was discovered in a laundry bag last Thursday morning.It was found in Greenwich, south-east London, but detectives say it may have been floating in the South Dock Marina for several days before anyone investigated the bag's contents.The bag was seen in the river last Wednesday, but the alarm was not raised until the following day.The woman is white and believed to be in her twenties or thirties. A local man has been arrested as part of the murder inquiry. He was released on bail last week, pending further inquiries.Detective Inspector Carl Mehta said: "A postmortem [examination] held at Greenwich mortuary last Friday gave the cause of death as neck injuries caused by a sharp instrument." The missing body parts had not yet been found, he said.Detectives are keen to speak to anyone who saw the bag near the marina, which is home to hundreds of houseboats and yachts. The bag was found in a lock running off the Thames into the marina. "The laundry bag is described as red, white and blue checks and is made of treated plastic," Mr Mehta said. "It has thin plastic handles, measures approximately three feet wide by two feet and closes with a zip."
