The lottery winner serving life for attempted rape is almost certainly immune from compensation claims, it emerged today.Iorworth Hoare, 52, who scooped one third of last week's Â£21m Lotto Extra jackpot in spite of being in the process of serving his 18-year sentence, was thought to have been open to claims from victims as a result of his new-found wealth.But SocietyGuardian.co.uk has learned that as Hoare's crimes date back at least 15 years, and in some cases even further, time limits on victim compensation laws effectively protect him from claims.Richard Scorer, a partner at law firm Pannone & Partners, said the law on this was "black and white". "The time limit for bringing compensation claims for these kind of crimes is six years," he said.The only exception to this rule is for child victims, he said. "If you are a child when the incident occurs, the clock doesn't start ticking until you turn 18 - so you would have until [aged] 24 to bring a claim," Mr Scorer said.However, even this is unlikely to make any difference in Hoare's case. He was convicted in 1989 for attempted rape, following a string of offences including rape, that began in 1973. The Law Commission published a report two years ago in which recommendations to change this law were put forward.However, it is understood that the government has no immediate plans to act on the commission's advice. "Like many Law Commission reports, it's probably gathering dust on a shelf," Mr Scorer said.Charity Victim Support also said Mr Hoare's victims were likely to be powerless to bring claims. "We understand that the length of time [that has passed] will make it difficult, nigh impossible, for victims to make a claim," a spokeswoman said.
