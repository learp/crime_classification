A community care worker was today found guilty of sexually assaulting a baby and allowing her boyfriend to take photographs of the abuse.Tracy Dawber, 44, let Colin Blanchard take the photos on his mobile phone as she assaulted the five-month-old child on the sofa of her home in Southport, Merseyside.Blanchard became notorious last year when she was convicted of sharing images of child abuse with a nursery nurse, Vanessa George, and another woman.Dawber was found guilty of one count of sexually assaulting a child and five counts of permitting indecent photographs of a child to be taken.She denied the charges, but Blanchard told the court she had taken the lead in the abuse. Blanchard, 40, of Rochdale in Greater Manchester, had already admitted being involved in the assault.Dawber mouthed the words "Oh, no" as the jury foreman at Winchester crown court delivered the first guilty verdict. She shook and wept as the other guilty verdicts were returned. The jury took two hours to find her guilty.Mr Justice Royce remanded Dawber in custody for pre-sentence reports. He told her: "These are serious offences. A custodial sentence of some length is inevitable."Dawber is the fourth woman connected with Blanchard to be convicted.George, from Plymouth, was jailed indefinitely last year after sending him pictures of abuse. Angela Allen, from Nottinghamshire, was jailed alongside George. A mother of nine called Tracy Lyons, from Portsmouth, has also been convicted of sexually abusing a toddler.Blanchard met the women on the internet.
