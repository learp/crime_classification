Headhunters may have to be used to overcome the reluctance of women and ethnic minority lawyers to apply to join an overwhelmingly white, male judiciary, the Commission for Judicial Appointments in England and Wales warned yesterday.The head commissioner, Sir Colin Campbell, said the move may be necessary to create a judiciary more representative of the population because of "a degree of cynicism" over the appointments process.Sir Colin, vice-chancellor of Nottingham University, said there was a risk that loopholes allowing interference from the lord chancellor and senior judges could carry over into the new, more independent regime, which starts next week.Launching the CJA's final annual report, Sir Colin said there was sometimes "no reasoning whatsoever" behind appointments. He called for an end to "automatic consultation", in which 75 senior judges are sent a list of possible appointees and asked to comment. Those consulted often made social comments, such as "decent cove" or "not very sociable at lunch".Sir Colin and his fellow commissioners have strongly criticised the system for lack of transparency and the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, for interference in appointments. From next Monday it will be replaced by a new independent Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC), which will take over the role of the lord chancellor in choosing the judges.The system had been improved greatly since the CJA was set up in 2001, said Sir Colin. The judiciary was now more diverse, with women accounting for 15.8% and ethnic minorities 2.6% in 2004, compared with 6.5% and 1% in 1992.The CJA has dealt with 52 complaints from candidates who felt their applications had not been treated fairly, 28 of which were upheld. But in six cases where the commission had recommended redress, the lord chancellor had refused.In a competition for part-time judges, the lord chancellor had made "ill-advised personal interventions altering the outcomes recommended by properly constituted selection panels".
