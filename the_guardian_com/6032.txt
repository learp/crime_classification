Home Office minister Hazel Blears today denied that police forces were being "bribed" for becoming early volunteers in controversial plans to merge forces.It emerged at the weekend that the Home Office has a fund - reported to be £125m - available to pay forces that are in the first wave of mergers.Police sources told the Press Association that forces had previously been told that they would have to borrow the money to pay for the reorganisation plan announced by the Home Office last month.The number of forces in England and Wales could be cut from 43 to as few as 12 under the plans, the most dramatic policing shake-up for 30 years.The Association of Police Authorities says that the mergers could cost up to £600m and has complained that the government is trying to rush the plans through.All forces have been asked to consider the best options for their region and to submit their final proposals for restructuring by the end of the year. The ASA says that only the forces that have agreed to a merger by this Friday will get the Home Office payments.Today the shadow home secretary, David Davis, complained that the government was rushing through the measures to avoid press scrutiny.Although the Tories are broadly in favour of rationalising police forces in principle, Mr Davis told the Commons the proposals were "happening too fast, without serious thought about the consequences ... and being driven by the wrong motives."Attacking the home secretary, Charles Clarke, for holding a Commons debate just before Christmas, after the police had largely prepared their response, and just after Tony Blair's major statement on the EU budget, he told MPs: "One might almost come to the conclusion that the home secretary did not want much press coverage for this issue."The chairman of the ASA, Bob Jones, said at the weekend that police forces will not be "bullied or bribed" and that some police authorities had "serious concerns whether [merging] will deliver the best policing for local people".Some authorities have threatened to refuse to cooperate with the home secretary unless he meets a series of demands, including a pledge that the government would meet all the merger costs.This morning, Ms Blears defended the plans to pay forces for merging early. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We have said we will try our best to come up with some start-up funds."We have said it is for early people who go down this track, because they will take the most risk. The people who come later will have the benefit of their experience. It's a totally appropriate thing to do."The shake-up follows a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary that said forces with less than 4,000 officers were not equipped to fight sophisticated modern crime.Ms Blears said today that having larger forces would improve neighbourhood policing."If you are a small force and you get a triple murder or a terrorist event, inevitably the pressure is to take all your officers away from the beat. If you bring forces together, they will be able to cope with these issues without abstracting those officers."That means the relationship with the community will be much, much closer because they won't be taking their neighbourhood officers away."But Mr Clarke is likely to get a rough ride from MPs this afternoon in the Commons when the police organisation reforms are debated. Some MPs from all parties have been critical of the plans.MPs of all parties have demanded the moves be put on hold so that they can be properly discussed amid claims the changes were being rushed.The Conservative home affairs spokesman, David Davis, attacked the merger plans.He told Today: "This is going to distance forces from their own communities. Huge forces, where it takes five hours to drive across regions, are not going to be particularly responsive to local communities."It is going to undermine accountability, it is not necessarily going to deliver more effectiveness and it is going to cost a small fortune - hundreds of millions of pounds."He said the plan would be hugely disruptive and could cost more than £500m and questioned predictions that it could save £70m a year.Mr Davis said that, while two or three forces might benefit from a merger, a more sensible solution for most would be a "federal" structure to facilitate the sharing of resources.
