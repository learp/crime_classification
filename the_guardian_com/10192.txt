Police said yesterday that they were questioning a 36-year-old man in connection with the murder of Milly Dowler, the 13-year-old who went missing on her way home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 2002. Her body was found in a Hampshire wood six months later.The man, from West Drayton, Middlesex, was arrested on Wednesday and held at a station in Surrey. A spokesman for Surrey police confirmed that the man, who has not been named, had connections with the Walton-on-Thames area. He described the man as "someone we need to eliminate", but added: "He is not someone we would describe as a nominated suspect." The man was later released on police bail. The inquiry into Milly's murder is the largest of its kind undertaken by the Surrey force. Home video footage of the teenager dancing was shown repeatedly on national television in the weeks after her disappearance. On the afternoon of March 21 2002, Milly got off a train from school at Walton-on-Thames, and at 4.08pm a friend standing at a bus stop saw her walking down Station Avenue towards her home. That was the last confirmed sighting of her alive. A huge search yielded nothing. But six months later a couple picking mushrooms in Yateley Heath Woods, near Fleet, Hampshire, about 20 miles from Walton-on-Thames, discovered Milly's body by chance. This year detectives gave details of a red car they believed might have been used in her abduction. The Daewoo Nexia - a 1996 N registration - was spotted on the road where Milly, whose real name was Amanda, was last seen alive. The car, which appeared to have very low-slung suspension, was caught on CCTV as it pulled out of the junction of Copenhagen Way and Station Avenue in Walton-on-Thames less than half an hour after Milly was last seen. Detectives say the car may have been driven by someone who had local connections. In March officers revealed that in three years they had questioned 2,885 people, taken 4,288 statements and carried out 127 searches.
