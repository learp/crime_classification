Murder investigations in London are being hampered by a serious lack of resources and must be given a higher priority, an inspector's report says today.A comprehensive review of the force by Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the former chief constable of the RUC, has found that murder squads are "severely stretched" and some senior investigating officers are working up to 127 hours a week, raising concerns about their health and welfare. On average, senior detectives are in charge of six cases at a time, compared with four in other forces. Sir Ronnie notes that though additional resources had been "identified on paper", some senior Met staff believe there is "a danger that homicide may continue to slip further down" the list of priorities. Sir Ronnie says he "strongly believes this must not be allowed to happen". "There are major risks to the [force] in terms of loss of public confidence if it does not provide an effective and well-resourced homicide investigation capability," he says. "These risks have been starkly demonstrated by the tragic deaths of Stephen Lawrence and Damilola Taylor." The report says the Met "desperately needs to enhance its detective skills base" and recommends that "homicide investigation is explicitly recognised as a priority and is appropriately resourced". Progress has been made since the last appraisal, but not enough, the report says. The Met investigated 202 murders in 2001-02 and solved 72% of the cases. A quarter of murders in England and Wales occur in the capital, and 70% of black murder victims live in London.The Met recently opened a crime academy based at Hendon, north-west London, which should increase the skills of young detectives. Sir Ronnie praises the Met's commissioner, Sir John Stevens, for providing robust leadership and says the force's response to the threat posed by terrorists is "world class".
