Families who force their daughters into marriage could face an appearance in court under controversial proposals to protect young British Asians from abuse.Community elders who encourage parents or connive in their arrangements could also be prosecuted in a wide-ranging crackdown to be unveiled tomorrow.The Home Office minister Baroness Scotland will launch a consultation on proposals to introduce a specific offence of 'forcing someone to marry'.The Home Office recognises that there are concerns children forced into marriage will not wish to see their parents prosecuted.At the same time, there are already offences such as kidnap, false imprisonment and child cruelty that can be used in forced marriage cases. But ministers believe a new offence could have an important deterrent effect on parents and relatives.'Forced marriage is a form of domestic violence and an abuse of human rights,' Baroness Scotland told The ObserverRefusing to go ahead with a forced marriage can see children cast out from a community - and at worst, can lead to 'honour killings' of those considered to have shamed their families by rebelling. Although often associated with young Asian girls kidnapped overseas to marry distant relatives, police believe is is not limited to the Asian community.The plan to make forced marriage a criminal offence is deeply controversial, coming amid the already heated debate over the integration of British ethnic minority communities following the London bombings. Campaigners say parents' decisions cannot be divorced from pressures within the wider community to maintain traditions.Those in the community liable to prosecution would be people 'who have direct influence' on the family. The new law would not ban traditional arranged marriages, under which parents choose a partner for their children, so long as both spouses are willing.It has divided campaigners against forced marriage, with some arguing that female victims do not actually want the measures supposedly for their protection.'A significant number of women we have consulted would be very disappointed to know that the Government is pushing for this,' said Baroness Uddin, the Labour peer who co-chaired a Home Office inquiry on forced marriage.Fellow working group member Hannana Siddiqui, of Southall Black Sisters which advises women trying to escape a forced marriage, said the offence could offer 'another weapon that women can use' to protect themselves.However, she said some could be dissuaded from seeking help if they thought their parents might be jailed: 'They want help, they want protection, but there may be a fear that it will go further than they want,' she said.
