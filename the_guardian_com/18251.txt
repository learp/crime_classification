Most of those who finally get indicted for the 5.2m offences in the new crime figures leading the headlines this morning will appear before unpaid fellow citizens (considerably more middle class than the usual run of offender) who give up half a day a week to dispense justice voluntarily. These form the lay magistracy of England and Wales.Magistrates' numbers have increased, as the chart shows, though case load has been broadly level. But in recent years lay magistrates have been losing out to the profes sionals. Volunteers are being usurped by the growing number of "stipendiaries" - district judges in effect - who now hear a third of all cases in many big cities. Today's 100-odd stipendiaries are double the number a decade ago. No fewer than 95 of every 100 criminal cases are heard in magistrates' courts rather than before a judge and jury. If the Labour government got its way and secured the passage of the mode of trial bill that was halted in the Lords last autumn, an even larger proportion of the serious cases for which defendants may currently opt for jury trial would be dealt with by magistrates. So what is the difference between the two classes of magistrate? Offenders do not know in advance whether they are to be tried by amateurs or professionals. In no other legal system does chance determine whether a case is heard by a panel of lay people or by a stipendiary, sitting alone. Only in England and Wales are paid and unpaid magistrates used interchangeably, as if the skills they bring to court were the same. They are not. Lay magistrates bring their local knowledge to the courts along with a broad range of social experience and a freshness in hearing evidence that is valuable in assessing character. They may better be able to judge honesty and the risk of reoffending. Professional lawyers, on the other hand, are experts and can handle increasingly complex legislation. They hear cases more quickly and with greater consistency. They have no need for the legal advice from justices' clerks on which lay magistrates rely. The qualities which lay and professional people bring to the party are thus complementary rather than interchangeable. In contested cases, both sets of skills are needed. In Community Justice, published today, Profes sor Andrew Sanders of Manchester University argues contested cases should always be heard by a mixed panel of two lay and one professional. There is significant support for that model among the public at large. In every serious case, the decision on guilt or innocence and on sentence would be based on that essential combination of legal expertise and lay judgment. Uncontested cases and routine applications for bail could safely be heard by district judges, sitting alone, as they rely on legal rather than "social" decision-making skills. If lay magistrates were never to hear cases in the absence of a professional judge they would need less expertise and training and sit less often in court. Serving on the bench would no longer need to be a prerogative of the middle classes and the over 60s. Many more might be willing to contribute, say, a half day per fortnight for two to five years: the system would be more participative, more jury-like. Lay magistrates have recently come to feel they are under close examination, perhaps even threat. At the end of last year the Home Office and Lord Chancellor's department published a detailed comparative study of the cost and effectiveness of the different types of magistrate by Professor Rod Morgan of Bristol University; a judge, Sir Robin Auld, is reviewing the staffing of the lower courts. Yet chancellor Gordon Brown has recently be extolling the volunteer spirit and the Magistrates Association is a formidable interest group which can raise a fuss, if it cares to. What is clear is that the status quo is not an option - because public confidence in magistrates as presently constituted is alarmingly low. Only 29% of the public think they do a good job. Some 61% believe they are out of touch. But the public are themselves out of touch, vastly underestimating the volume of cases heard in the lower courts. Four people out of 10 are unaware that most magistrates are lay people. One in two are concerned to learn that they do not have full legal training. Yet for every person who told Professor Sanders they wanted a legally qualified person involved ("If the people are not trained as lawyers, I don't think I would have confidence in them") another welcomed the community ties and voluntary commitment of the lay members. Mixed panels would cost more than either a judge sitting alone or lay magistrates alone. But the number of cases for which a panel would be needed would be small relative to the whole. Cost savings would be made when judges sat alone for the routine, uncontested cases and because legally-qualified clerks would no longer be needed to advise on the law. Lay magistrates are likely to see this proposal as demotion. The gain would be the greater transparency from the involvement of a broader cross-section of the community, the greater efficiency of court proceedings and confidence in the decisions taken. When violent crime is rising, yet confidence in the courts is so low, the question is not whether to reform the system, only when.
