A computer hacker who took control of his victims' webcams was jailed for 18 months today.Matthew Anderson, 33, was a key member of an international gang who abused his skills as a computer security expert to target businesses and individuals with spam containing hidden viruses.He accessed highly personal data and photographs in a sophisticated email scam from his mother's front room, taking control of some victim's webcams remotely to see inside their homes, at one point boasting to a friend that he made a teenage girl cry by doing so.Files he saved on his own computer included webcam images of a girl in school uniform, a family photograph of a mother and her newborn baby in hospital and intimate pictures of a sexual nature.Anderson, who admitted an offence under the Computer Misuse Act, appeared at Southwark crown court in central London.Sentencing, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC said Anderson's offending was on an "almost unimaginable scale"."Whilst you may not have been engaged in fraud, it is fair to say that in an age in which computers play such an important part in the lives of so many people and businesses, an offence of this nature inevitably raises great concern and consternation," he said.He added: "Conduct of this kind must be deterred. Plainly only a custodial sentence is justified for an offence of this nature."Anderson, from Keith, Banffshire, Scotland, also saved CVs, wills and confidential medical reportsRivlin said Anderson would have faced a jail sentence twice as long had he committed the offences under the most recent law, the Police and Justice Act 2006.Anderson, who told another friend his scam would "hit the news big time", was caught after an investigation by Scotland Yard and authorities in Finland into a gang writing computer viruses to order.Investigators discovered that the so-called m00p group was infecting computers using viruses attached to unsolicited commercial emails.Davies said they were "at the cutting edge of international viral emails of this sort", describing Anderson as being "part of the top-end international hacking community".Simon Ward, defending, said in court that Anderson joined online chatrooms after being left housebound by panic attacks in his early 20s.He said he had been motivated by "the feeling of power that comes from the knowledge that you have control over something that others don't know you have the control of".He said Anderson had been a "foolish young man" but had now matured and had the support of his partner, who sat in the public gallery for the hearing.Anderson was told he would serve half of his 18-month sentence, and was ordered to pay Â£5,000 costs.The judge commended the "major" police investigation in court, saying it was "conducted to the highest standard".In October, Anderson pleaded guilty to one charge of causing unauthorised modifications to the contents of computers between September 2005 and June 2006.The offence was committed when Anderson was on bail for attacking the computer systems of the British National Party and the Countryside Alliance.
