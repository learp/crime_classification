Confiscation orders designed to ensure crime does not pay provide neither value for money nor a credible deterrent as perpetrators keep all but 26p in every £100 generated by the criminal economy, according to a damning report.While the estimated loss to the economy through fraud last year stood at £52bn, enforcement agencies collected just £133m, which cost taxpayers an estimated £102m in administration costs to recoup, said the National Audit Office (NAO).There appeared to be "no coherent overall strategy" across relevant bodies, and an "insufficient awareness of proceeds of crime and its potential impact" through the criminal justice system, the NAO said.Only 2% of offenders paid in full last year, and sanctions for not paying orders, such as default prison sentences of up to 10 years and additional 8% interest on the amount owed, "do not work", it said.Even with the full range of recovery techniques, including taxation, perpetrators still kept an estimated £99.65 out of every £100 generated by the criminal economy.The "efficiency and effectiveness" of the confiscation order system was "hampered by outdated, slow ICT systems, data errors and poor joint working". There was too much manual re-entering of information, with the Courts and Tribunals Service's regional confiscation units spending 45 hours a week manually entering information into multiple systems.Appropriate action was not being taken early enough "to prevent offenders hiding or disposing of assets once they realise they are under suspicion", said the report.Despite a total of 673,000 convictions last year, including those with a financial element, only 6,392 confiscation orders were issued. One of the reasons was that senior police officers and others were not giving the issue "sufficient priority""The use of confiscation orders to deny criminals the proceeds of their crimes is not proving to be value for money," said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO. "The government has not specified a target but only about 26p in every £100 of criminal proceeds was actually confiscated in 2012-13."The fundamental problem is a lack of strategic direction and agreement on what level of confiscation would constitute success. This is compounded by poor information, lack of knowledge, outdated IT systems, data errors and ineffective sanctions. There is a sharp need for a coherent and joined-up cross-government strategy.""At the moment this activity cannot be seen as value for money nor as a credible deterrent to crime".The report acknowledged not all crimes are reported to law enforcement agencies, relatively few go to court, and fewer still result in conviction. Sophisticated criminals could also "transfer or dispose of assets quickly across the world," it said."Despite these practical barriers, the amounts that are actually confiscated are small, especially when set against successive governments' tough approach and ambitious goals, and the powerful supporting legal framework."It said the government's recently published organised crime strategy, led by the Home Office, recognised the need for more collaboration and a more targeted approach "which is encouraging".The Courts and Tribunal Service "successfully collects 90% of their orders under £1,000" but across the courts, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office "there is a lack of cost and time data" and information about what is collectable, it said.A Home Office spokesperson said: "Our serious and organised crime strategy sets out how the Home Office will make it even harder for criminals to move, hide and use the proceeds of crime. This government will make sure that crime does not pay and over the past three years we have recovered more criminal assets than ever before. Since 2010, we have confiscated £475m from offenders, frozen assets worth more than £1.5bn and returned £65m to victims."We continue to work with other government departments to further strengthen our response."A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said:"We are grateful to the National Audit Office for this thorough report which notes that the Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office work hard to enforce their respective orders and have some good practice in place. A great deal of work is going on in these law officers' departments to improve asset-recovery performance and the recommendations will inform this. The CPS is creating a new national approach to confiscation, introducing a better performance, assurance and governance regime. The SFO robustly enforces confiscation orders arising from the cases it prosecutes and has a specialist multi-disciplinary division dedicated solely to proceeds of crime casework."Case studyThe National Audit Office reported highlighted the case of one unnamed offender convicted in September 2008 for a complex fraud relating to precious metals trading."The confiscation case was heard in August 2010 with the judge ruling that the offender had benefited by over £1bn. However, the actual order made was £20m, much of which was considered hidden overseas."There were significant complications to this case, including monies being transferred through multiple trust funds, bankruptcy imposition on the various companies set up for the crime, and the offender's wife claiming ownership of assets. The offender has paid just £200,000 as of September 2013 and is currently serving a seven-year default sentence for non-payment."
