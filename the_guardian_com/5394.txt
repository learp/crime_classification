Only one prison out of 138 in England and Wales has been identified as having a recognised alcohol abuse programme in place, according to a report published today.A recent survey by the prime minister's strategy unit estimates the cost of alcohol-related crime and public disorder to be in the region of Â£7.3bn a year. The Prison Reform Trust report, Alcohol and re-offending - Who Cares, is based on Prison Service statistics, and says alcohol-related offences ought to be a key issue for the government.Two-thirds of the 74,000 people in prison are regarded as "hazardous drinkers", and half of those have a "severe alcohol-dependency problem", yet available schemes are ignored by the service. Prison staff who want to tackle the problem must do so out of existing funding. According to figures from the British Crime Survey, almost half the victims of violent crime say that the perpertrator was influenced by alcohol. Enver Solomon, the trust's policy officer and report author, says the problem is urgent: "Prisons, particularly young offender institutions, are flooded with prisoners with alcohol problems."It is a failure on the part of the prison service that so little has been done to change their behavior. Access to alcohol treatment is not a luxury, it is a necessary step to prevent further offending."e.allison@theguardian.com
