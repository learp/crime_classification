Lord Nasir Ahmed of Rotherham made history in 1998 when he became the first Muslim to become a life peer in Britain's House of Lords.Today he gained notoriety after joining a small band of peers who have been convicted of a criminal offence and jailed while still in parliament.The jailing is a low point for the Labour peer after a lifetime of achievement in several areas. He has been praised for his public service, as a successful businessman, a Labour party activist, and a key figure in Britain's Muslim community.His high point was in 2007 when he flew to Sudan to secure the freedom of Gillian Gibbons, a British woman jailed in a row over naming a teddy bear after the Muslim prophet, Mohammed.Ahmed had close links with Sudanese people and had met the president, Omar al-Bashir, a decade earlier, which proved to be an ice-breaker during the talks over Gibbons' release.The talks in Khartoum eventually led to a presidential pardon for the teacher.Ahmed ignored Foreign Office advice not to go, eventually flying out as an individual parliamentarian, not as a representative of the British government.It was typical of the 51-year-old's independence of mind from his own party. He fell out with some senior figures in the government when he refused to endorse the Iraq war, with Labour desperate for Muslim voices in favour of it.Ahmed comes from Rotherham, and before being ennobled he ran a chain of fish and chip shops. He was also a justice of the peace, and during the 1990s was a local councillor.Born in Kashmir, he was educated at Spurley Hey comprehensive school, in Rotherham, and studied public administration at Sheffield Hallam University.He was an influential figure in British Muslim life and maintained his links and feel for the grassroots of the community. He is married, with two sons and a daughter.Most recently, in between his conviction and sentencing, he was in the headlines for opposing the showing of a Dutch film in the House of Lords which explicitly said Islam was an inherently violent religion.He has served on policy advisory groups for the government on issues as diverse as forced marriages and the training of imams.In 2007 he said Muslim women in the west should not wear the niqab, or full-face veil, saying: "The veil is now a mark of separation, segregation and defiance against mainstream British culture."But there's nothing in the Qur'an to say that the wearing of a niqab is desirable, let alone compulsory. It's purely cultural. It's an identity thing which has been misinterpreted."They were supposed to be worn so that women wouldn't be harassed."But my argument is that women, and communities as a whole, are now being harassed because they are wearing them."He condemned the government's decision to knight the author Salman Rushdie, whose book The Satanic Verses caused anger in parts of the Muslim world. Ahmed has also said that the terrorists who attacked London on 7 July 2005 had suffered an identity crisis.He is a member of numerous organisations, including those trying to improve relationships between the west and Muslim people, and is a trustee of the British Heart Foundation.
