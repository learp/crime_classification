Two men remain in custody after appearing in court charged with the murders of three men struck by a car during the riots in Birmingham.A 23-year-old man was also charged with their murder on Sunday night, but has yet to appear in court. Adam King, 23, from Kings Norton in Birmingham, is expected to appear on Monday morning.Joshua Donald, 26, from Ladywood, appeared in court charged with three counts of murder at a brief hearing at Birmingham magistrates court. Donald and a 17-year-old male from Winson Green, Birmingham, who cannot be named due to his age, were arrested on Thursday and charged after police were given extra time to question them.Haroon Jahan, 21, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, died after they were hit by the car in theÂ early hours of Wednesday while trying to protect shops from looters in Winson Green.A spokeswoman for West Midlands police confirmed that a 32-year-old man who was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of murder was bailed, as was a 16-year-old boy, pending further inquiries. Another man, 27, who was arrested late on Saturday was also bailed.Police confirmed they had recovered a third vehicle believed to be involved and are carrying out forensic tests on a black Audi A3. Detective Chief Inspector Anthony Tagg said: "We are now confident we have recovered all three vehicles which we believe were involved in the murder."An estimated 2,000 people gathered in Summerfield Park, near Winson Green, to show unity and solidarity against the rioters.The crowd observed a minute's silence in honour of the three men, while figures from the city spoke about their love of the city and the need for solidarity and calm.People at the event heard from Tariq Jahan, father of one of the victims, who, in the hours following his son's death, urged people on the streets to keep calm so that no one else would get hurt.At the event, which ran under the banner "one Birmingham, one city, one voice for peace", Jahan said the show of unity was giving him strength. "All I can ask is, forget about me, I'm nobody. Remember the three that sacrificed their lives for this community."He added: " They didn't die in vain, they died for this community, and I hope this community will remember them."He had been overwhelmed with messages of support from the community, the wider UK and the rest of the world, he said, thanking everyone who had got in touch on behalf of his wife and family.Addressing the crowd after hearing that some Muslims were unhappy about the inclusion of music at the event, he said: "This is not about Islam, this is a community, we are here for everyone."
