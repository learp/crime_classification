Police detectives have arrested nine people, including two teenage boys, in connection with the shooting of two likely innocent bystanders in north London last week.Scotland Yard said six people were detained at Gatwick airport on Tuesday following the incident in Wood Green on Friday night. Father-of-two Erdoğan Güzel was killed in the shooting and pronounced dead at the scene and a woman was seriously injured. Two 16-year-old boys, two men aged 20 and 25, and two women aged 21 and 61 were arrested at Gatwick on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.Three other men aged 23, 26 and 55 were arrested at an address in Hornsey, north London, on suspicion of murder. They remain in custody.Police believe the two victims were not the intended targets and were probably innocent bystanders who were not known to each other. The incident happened just outside Brothers Bakery in Lordship Lane, where Güzel would often sit, witnesses said. A friend, who asked not to be named, said: “He was always on this street, he lived nearby … He was a good guy.” He said Güzel had two children, a son and a daughter aged around 15 and 16, who were on holiday in Turkey at the time of the shooting.
