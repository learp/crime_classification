Proposals for new means tests are being put forward by the government in an attempt to curb the £2bn legal aid bill.Under the plans, which are likely to hit the middle classes in particular, aid in cases tried by magistrates could be limited to those with a disposable income of less than £10,000 after essential expenses such as rent or mortgage. The move, floated by the constitutional affairs minister, David Lammy, would hit many people charged with driving offences, as well as some charged with burglary, theft, robbery and criminal damage. A spokeswoman for the Department of Constitutional Affairs confirmed that the measure will be included in the forthcoming draft criminal defence bill which will go out to consultation before being tabled in parliament. Mr Lammy insisted that the proposal was not primarily designed to reduce the £2bn annual bill for legal aid. Speaking to the Times newspaper, he said: "We want to ensure the money goes on those who most need it ... so that if people fall on hard times, they can rely on legal aid. I think the time has come to look very seriously at means testing of criminal defendants to see if they are entitled to legal aid." His comments were echoed by the spokeswoman for his department, who said: "These proposals are not about cutting legal aid funds, but ensuring that legal aid goes to those who need it most." About 593,000 motorists went through the courts in 2002, and officials believe that most of them would be able to afford the average £300-£500 cost of a magistrates court defence.
