I agree we must ensure that sentencing policy and prison capacity are better aligned to ensure that the public are protected (Response, February 6). Public protection is our first priority. It is why the home secretary commissioned a prison building programme for 8,000 new places so that serious and dangerous offenders can be imprisoned. But we have also consistently said there are better options than imprisonment for less serious non-violent offenders. This is not about being soft on sentencing; it is about having a proportionate response to offending which targets resources and makes an impact on reducing reoffending. It is about making sure, where appropriate, that offenders are punished with fines or challenged with tough community orders and pay something back to the community through unpaid work. That message needs to be heard.But this isn't just about sending messages. When we published our review of the criminal justice system last July, we wanted to start a debate on sentencing with the public and sentencers. Our public consultation Making Sentencing Clearer acknowledges the fact that sentencing has become tougher over the past decade. Trying to ensure consistency in sentencing is one reason this government agreed, following John Halliday's report, to set up the independent Sentencing Guidelines Council. Magistrates and judges must exercise their discretion in individual cases. But it is right to have a broader debate and I recognise the potential that an open dialogue between government and the SGC can have in helping to achieve equilibrium between sentencing policy and the capacity of the whole corrections system.
