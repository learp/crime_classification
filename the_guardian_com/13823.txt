More than 50 ex-offenders kill themselves each year after leaving jail because of inadequate support from the prison and probation service, a report claims today.The report, by the Howard League for Penal Reform charity, reveals that ex-prisoners are vulnerable to suicide but inmates serving short sentences receive little or no preparation for release. It says the supervision for long term prisoners concentrates too much on public protection rather than the offender's welfare. "Thousands of prisoners leave prison every year with nowhere to go and no support," said report author Claire McCarthy. Suicide and Self Harm Prevention Following Release from Prison is the first report of its kind, and calls for all prisoners to receive support from the probation service after their release.Ms McCarthy said: "The probation service must pay as much attention to identifying and supporting those who are at risk of suicide as it does to the identification of dangerous offenders and the protection of the public."Secondly, the prison service must recognise that it is not good enough to get each prisoner out of their door and breathe a sigh of relief." The report demands that independent investigations are carried out for all deaths that occur in prison and within a week of release or while under probation officers' supervision.It also calls for a safer supervision group to be set up within the probation service to provide suicide prevention training for all probation and hostel staff.
