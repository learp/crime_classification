The Metropolitan police "will never let up" in its efforts to bring the killers of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence to justice, Britain's most senior police officer said today.The Met's commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, said the force had spoken to Stephen's parents in the last few days to assure them that the case remained open and that the force had not given up its attempts to catch those responsible.Sir Ian made the comments to members of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) in the wake of new claims, contained in a BBC documentary shown last night, that the original bungled investigation into Stephen's murder was undermined by police corruption.The commissioner said that despite the new allegations about the Lawrence investigation, it was important to remember that the Met had changed hugely in the past decade.Sir Ian insisted the force had undertaken unparalleled anti-corruption work and had spent years learning the lessons from the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen's racist murder by a gang in April 1993.The BBC investigation carried claims from a former detective, Neil Putnam, who was convicted of corruption, that his former colleague Detective Sergeant John Davidson was paid to obstruct the case by Clifford Norris, whose son David was one of the prime suspects.Scotland Yard has said that despite an in-depth corruption investigation, there was never any evidence of misconduct by Mr Davidson in relation to the Lawrence case. Mr Davidson, who now runs a bar in Spain, denies the claims.Today, Sir Ian said the Met would take a "rigorous and appropriate approach to the matters raised in this programme" but added that it was important the fallout from the BBC programme should not "impact on our community confidence at this moment".Sir Ian, who was not part of the team investigating Stephen's murder, told the MPA: "The Stephen Lawrence murder investigation remains open. The Metropolitan police service will never let up, certainly not on my watch, in our endeavour to bring the perpetrators to justice. In the last few days we have spoken both to Neville and Doreen Lawrence to that end."While these events cast a long shadow they do have very little resonance with the current state of the Metropolitan police - a Metropolitan police that has entirely revamped its approach to homicide, which has virtually excavated corruption within its ranks with an investment and determination unmatched anywhere else."Stephen's parents, Doreen and Neville, have complained separately to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), regarding the allegations made in the programme.The Met's deputy commissioner, Paul Stephenson, confirmed today that both complaints would be referred back to the IPCC for it to decide on how they should be investigated. Mr Stephenson told authority members that it was up to the IPCC to examine whether or not the claims in the BBC documentary amounted to new evidence.Speaking to the MPA, Sir Ian, whose period in office has been punctuated by controversy, hit back at claims that the Met had been told of the allegations eight years ago but had not acted upon them."The suggestion I think that has been made that the Metropolitan police went out of its way to mislead a public inquiry - I have absolutely no reason at all to believe that is true, quite the reverse," Sir Ian said."It is for the inquiry to investigate the complaints. What we have is an audit trail of letters suggesting the opposite in my view. We did write to the [Macpherson] inquiry, Lord Stevens [a former Met commissioner] wrote to the inquiry saying this individual was the subject of a corruption investigation."Len Duvall, the chairman of the MPA, said it had "serious concerns about the allegations of corruption made in the BBC documentary".He said: "This case is not closed and if new information comes to light the MPA's expectation is that the [Metropolitan Police] will carry out a full investigation."The man who led the reinvestigation of the murder has said he feared that corrupt officers may have helped shield the killers. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve led the third squad which tried to find enough evidence to gain murder convictions for the 1993 stabbing of the gifted student at a south-east London bus stop. He is the most senior police figure to give any degree of credence to the allegations about corruption in the Lawrence case.Stephen Lawrence was killed in an unprovoked street attack by a gang of five white youths who hurled racist insults before stabbing him. Five men were arrested and three were tried in a private prosecution, but no one was convicted. The Lawrence family blamed bungled policing, and all five suspects have been repeatedly identified as the killers in the media over the years and have not taken legal action.
