Extra police will be deployed in a village exactly one year on from when a grandmother was murdered as she housesat for friends.Senior officers said the move was to reassure residents after artist Valerie Graves, 55, was found bludgeoned with a claw hammer in a ground-floor bedroom last year on 30 December.Her murderer, who struck at Graves’s friends’ waterside property in Smugglers Lane, Bosham, West Sussex, has not been caught despite a large investigation.More than 9,500 people have been interviewed, a £20,000 reward has been put up, a BBC Crimewatch appeal has been made and a limited DNA match of a suspect has been yielded.Exactly one year on from the brutal killing, police will return to Bosham on 29 – 30 December to speak to residents and visitors in an attempt to force a breakthrough. Det Supt Nick May, of the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said on Wednesday: “We need the public’s help to catch this person before they hurt someone else and to get justice for Valerie and her family.“Since the murder, officers have interviewed more than 9,500 people, of which 8,000 of these were during the house-to-house inquiries, and taken 580 statements as part of the investigation, but feel there may still be witnesses with important information who have not yet come forward.“There will be police officers in Smugglers Lane and Bosham Lane, Bosham, on 29 and 30 December from 10am to 4pm who residents and visitors can speak to if they have any information.”Ch Insp Justin Burtenshaw, of Sussex police, said: “I would urge any residents or visitors to come forward and speak to my officers if they have any information about the murder. I have ensured that there will be extra patrols on the night of 29 December in the area to reassure residents.”Graves was murdered as she housesat with her sister Jan, mother Eileen and her sister’s partner, Nigel Acres, while the property’s owners holidayed abroad over Christmas. The death shocked the small community of Bosham, which featured in an episode of the ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders.This week Graves’s two children Tim Wood, 32, and Jemima Harrison, 35, spoke – along with Acres – ahead of the first anniversary of her murder. The family said Christmas this year is “on hold” as they prepare for their first festive season without Graves and as her murderer still remains at large.Wood said: “It’s hard to carry on knowing that someone is out there able to do it to someone else and knowing that they haven’t been caught for what they have done.”Acres said Graves’s murder has been deeply felt by her sister who found her body, particularly as the pair had started to see more of each other. Graves had recently moved back to Sussex from Scotland to help care for her elderly mother in Bracklesham Bay.Acres said: “(Jan’s) struggling, poor thing. It has completely devastated her. To catch the person who was responsible will bring some closure.”A postmortem revealed Graves suffered significant head and facial injuries. A 22-year-old man arrested over her murder was later freed without charge. Police have asked people to undergo voluntary DNA testing to eliminate them from their inquiries – a move supported by Graves’s family.Anyone with information is asked to call Sussex Police on 101, quoting Operation Ensign, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
