Public confidence in the supervision of high-risk offenders released from prison suffered a fresh blow yesterday with the disclosure that 83 have been charged with a further serious offence, such as murder or rape, in the last year.The figure for 2006-07 compares with 61 high-risk offenders who committed further serious crimes while under the supervision of the probation and police services in the previous year.The Ministry of Justice figures show that 12 of the 83 were among the 1,249 offenders categorised as level three - known as the "critical few" - and under the highest levels of supervision. The publication of the figures revived the argument over the quality of parole, probation and police supervision in cases such as Anthony Rice who murdered Naomi Bryant, and Damien Hanson and Elliott White who killed city banker John Monckton while under supervision.The annual figures for offenders under supervision show that there are 48,668 on the sex and violent offenders register. That includes 30,416 sex offenders.The statistics show that 1,731 of them were returned to prison for breaching their release licence terms - more than 10% of the 15,487 level 2 and level 3 medium and highest risk category offenders.A further 90 were returned to prison for breaching a sexual offences prevention order and 83 were charged with serious further offences defined as murder, attempted murder, rape, arson, manslaughter, kidnap and armed robbery.The 83 cases exclude offenders classed as category 1 who are lower risk but are believed to commit the majority of further serious crimes.Liberal Democrat justice spokesman David Heath said: "For even one offender to commit another serious offence while under supervision is unacceptable."For 83 to do so in a single year ... is a catastrophic failure."A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: "Each of these offences represents tremendous distress and suffering for the victims. The rate of serious offending in this very specific group has, however, been under 1% for the past three years."She said that part of the increase in serious further offending may follow a clarification in the reporting rules and that from next April a new process for reviewing what had gone wrong in each case would be introduced.The justice minister, Maria Eagle, said Britain had one of the most advanced systems in the world for monitoring and managing dangerous offenders. "But we are not complacent and continue to look for ways to improve how we manage these offenders."The Conservative justice spokesman, Nick Herbert, said the leap in the number of serious crimes committed by offenders on licence was a real concern, "as is the fact that these figures tell us nothing about the extent of serious crimes committed by 30,000 offenders being monitored at level 1. Such criminals receive the lowest level of supervision and it is likely that a very high proportion are re-offending".
