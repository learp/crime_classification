Police appealed for calm last night after two meetings with angry neighbours of a teenage girl who was killed after being hit by a patrol car on Monday in the West End of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Officers sealed off the scene after friends of 16-year-old Hayley Adamson threw bricks and her boyfriend was immobilised by a Taser stun gun and arrested.The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an inquiry and said the officer driving the car, who was alone, had gone off duty and would be investigated. Hayley died in hospital after the accident on Monday in Denton Road, which she was crossing with friends from Sacred Heart high school. She had been due to sit her GCSE English exam yesterday. Flowers were piled up outside the home she shared with her mother in nearby Fenham. Headteacher Patricia Wager described her as "happy, popular and fun-loving".Chief Superintendent Paul Wier, head of the police inquiry into the accident, said: "Emotions are running high and that is understandable. But the best thing everybody can do now is to keep calm and allow the IPCC people to do their jobs."A number of arrests were made immediately after the incident for violence and disorder - people were distressed and some were throwing bricks."David Forrest, 20, a friend of Hayley, said: "There were seven of us about to cross the road. I looked both ways and couldn't see any vehicles coming. But when I reached the curb on the other side, I heard an almighty bang. The police car had come out of nowhere. After the crash loads of Hayley's friends came to the scene and were going mad at the police." Gary Garland, IPCC commissioner for the north-east, said the police car's automatic number recognition system had been activated, but it was not clear whether emergency warning equipment had been turned on.
