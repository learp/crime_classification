A website set up to track down the UK's most wanted paedophiles has helped locate nine child sex offenders in its first year, police said today.Four of the 13 sex offenders whose details were posted on the Most Wanted website when it launched are still at large.The website, run by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), today posted digitally aged images of two of those men in an attempt to help track them down.It is the first time digital age-progression techniques have been used on images of sex offenders. The technology is already used to digitally age photographs of missing children.The pictures of the two wanted sex offenders, Joshua Karney and Peter Weatherley, were produced by the Missing People charity.The details of a fourteenth Ceop target, Stephen Clare, a 35-year-old photographer, have been added to the site today. Clare, who is wanted by Northumbria police, has undertaken qualifications to teach English as a foreign language and may have travelled abroad, according to the site.Jim Gamble, the Ceop chief executive, said the site acted as a deterrent to paedophiles tempted to evade the conditions of being on the sex offenders' register.He said: "Nine offenders now know the true power of this new approach, nine offenders now know that they cannot escape the consequences of their crime."Natalie Cronin, the head of policy at the NSPCC, said: "In its first year, this website has proved to be an invaluable resource in helping to track down and catch child sex offenders who have flouted the sex offender register and disappeared off the radar."Child sex offenders who go underground pose a very real risk to children. We urge the public: if you know where they are, tell the police. They must be found to stop them striking again."
