From research figures, at least half of the "1,000 children" (Doctors and schools to spot 1,000 children at risk of turning to crime, March 19) are likely to be mentally impaired with such problems as clinical depression, autism, psychosis, suicidal tendencies and personality disorders. Further, from the government's own evaluation reports of "sin bin" projects for intensive family support, 80% of the families targeted had serious mental health and learning disability problems. Against this sort of background, are not the attentions of "assertive and persistent key worker" mentors under the new government schemes risible, unless they are qualified to deal with mental health problems, and is not the asbo enforcement mechanism proposed a formula for criminalising innocent 10-year-olds?Stephen Jakobi Convener, Children Aren't CriminalsThe latest aggressive move to tackle youth crime by rooting out the potential perpetrators wherever they may be has a familiar ring to it. Perhaps they should call it the war on little terrors.Roy Grimwood Market Drayton, Shropshire Many people with expert knowledge of the youth justice system in England and Wales will welcome the recommendation of the chief inspector of prisons to temporarily close Oakhill secure training centre (Report, March 17). But why stop there? The imprisonment of children for profit is ethically unsustainable. Perhaps more significantly, Oakhill has repeatedly shown itself to be unfit for purpose. If the abuse of children at Oakhill is to be stopped, it must be closed permanently.Professor Barry GoldsonUniversity of Liverpool
