The victim of an alleged rape tried to kill herself when a detective failed to investigate her complaint and lied about the outcome of the case, a court has heard.DC Hannah Notley, of Essex police, was jailed for four months on Friday after admitting she had not investigated the allegation properly and had falsely told the victim and senior police officers that prosecutors had found there was no case to answer.Notley had told the alleged victim and her superiors that the Crown Prosecution Service had decided not to pursue the case, when in reality she had never passed the file to them.As Notley was sentenced at Southwark crown court, prosecutors revealed that the victim of the alleged rape had tried to kill herself. "The alleged victim stated that on the evening she was telephoned by Notley to say there was no further action she tried to take her own life," said Zoe Martin, prosecuting.Notley, 30, from Benfleet, Essex, who was a sexual-offences-trained detective at Essex CID, admitted misconduct in public office between 6 July 2011 and 21 April 2012.Martin told the court that after Notley was assigned to the case, a suspect was arrested and interviewed, and his mobile phone and computer examined.But when Notley was later asked what had happened in the case, she told a superior the CPS had decided not to pursue it. When it was logged on the police system as having "no further action", Notley failed to put superiors straight and even told the alleged victim that CPS lawyers had decided to drop the case, despite knowing it had never been passed to them.Martin said: "She falsely informed her superiors and the victim of the case that the CPS had advised that no further action be taken against the suspect when in fact no file had been sent to the CPS, no such advice had been received."In reality, Ms Notley had not submitted the file to the CPS and no lawyer had been allocated to the case, and clearly it follows that no decision had been made by the CPS."In February last year, Notley spoke to the complainant, telling her the CPS had dropped the case because she had reported it too late so there was no physical evidence. "She [the complainant] was clearly upset because it implied that the NFA [no further action] decision to some extent was her fault for reporting the rape late in the day," Martin said.An independent adviser allocated to the complainant pursued the matter and it transpired that the CPS had never been sent the file.Notley originally told the adviser she would "chase" prosecutors, but when she realised the truth was coming out in April last year, she contacted her professional standards department and confessed.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had uncovered issues with the supervision of Notley as a trainee detective within the Essex force.The IPCC also found a case to answer for misconduct in a second investigation by Notley into an allegation of sexual touching reported in May 2011. Key actions were left incomplete and decisions were not recorded and documented correctly. This meant there was no accurate description of why the case was closed on the force's crime recording system.
