A man wanted for questioning over a murder in Northern Ireland has been arrested in his native Derry.Kieran McLaughlin was discovered hiding in a car in the Galliagh area of the city at around 3am on Wednesday.The Police Service of Northern Ireland took the unusual step last Friday of naming the 58-year-old as someone it needed to talk to in connection with the murder in Derry city last Thursday of Barry McCrory.Armed police officers were drafted into the area after reports that McLaughlin had stolen a car in Galliagh. He had earlier been spotted just across the border in Co Donegal driving a silver car. Garda√≠ were involved in following McLaughlin as he left the Republic and crossed back into Northern Ireland, with the southern officers in close contact with the PSNI.A PSNI spokesman said that while McLaughlin was armed, no shots were fired during the arrest operation. It is understood that police searching the vehicle thought there may have been a second weapon in it. Chief Inspector Andy Lemon, who was in charge of the search and arrest operation, said: "There were no shots fired, there was no one hurt."McLaughlin will now be questioned about the shooting of McCrory, 35, in his top-floor apartment in Shipquay Street in Derry city centre. His partner was in the flat at the time and the gunman involved in the killing forced her into another room before firing the fatal shots at McCrory.Hours before McLaughlin's capture, the PSNI had issued a warning that other people known to McCrory in Derry might be under threat.There had been reports that McLaughlin had been sighted in Derry as his family, priests and local politicians made repeated calls for him to give himself up. Meanwhile, the fallout from an unrelated murder in Belfast by a group calling itself "the IRA" continues with the terrorist group naming two men it says must leave Northern Ireland on Wednesday or face death.A statement by the dissident republican organisation was read out by masked men in a north Belfast bar earlier this week. It warned that the pair, who they said were associates of murdered father-of-four Kevin Kearney, had to flee the city within 48 hours.
