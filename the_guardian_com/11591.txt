Two small spools of forensic sticky tape led to the man responsible for a child murder which resulted in one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice, a court was told yesterday.Stored for nearly 30 years in a Home Office laboratory, the tape provided an instant and exact DNA link between shopkeeper Ronald Castree and the killing of 11-year-old Lesley Molseed in 1975, for which an innocent man was jailed for 16 years.The dramatic breakthrough in the long hunt for the real killer of the child, a "dainty little imp" according to her mother giving evidence as the trial's first witness yesterday, came when DNA was taken from 53-year-old Mr Castree after an "unrelated and irrelevant incident" two years ago.Julian Goose QC, prosecuting, told Bradford crown court that the samples had been compared - a regular test in serious unsolved cases - and the precise match had been found.Checks on Mr Castree, who denies murder, revealed that he had been convicted of abducting and sexually molesting a nine-year-old child only nine months after Lesley's stabbed body was found on moorland overlooking the trans-Pennine M62 motorway.The tapes, which were used to lift microscopic evidence from Lesley's underwear in the original inquiry, survived though the murdered child's clothing was destroyed in the 1980s, which was routine procedure after successful convictions. At that stage, Mr Goose told the jury of six men and six women, the Molseed case was considered "cleared up," with a shy tax clerk, Stefan Kiszko, jailed for life in 1976.Mr Kiszko, a loner who lived near Lesley and her family in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was prosecuted by a future lord chief justice, Peter Taylor, and defended by a future home secretary, David Waddington."You may recall the name of Stefan Kiszko," Mr Goose told the jurors. "It is a name which helps to explain why, in 2007, you are trying the case of a murder which took place in 1975. Mr Kiszko served over 16 years in prison for a crime he did not commit." Mr Kiszko was cleared of the murder in 1991, after proof, later reinforced by DNA profiling, that his infertility meant that he could not have been the killer.Detectives promptly reopened the case which began when Lesley skipped off to the local shops on an October Sunday because her mother, April Garrett, needed bread and an air freshener.Mrs Garrett told the court how Lesley had tried to wheedle 3p out of her for the errand, because the family rota said it was the turn of her brother, Frederick, to shop, but he was out playing football.Mrs Garrett told the court: "I wish you could have seen her - she looked hilarious. She had whipped her sister's Bay City Roller socks and put them on her feet and had them over her shoes. When she had left I couldn't stop laughing." Mr Goose described how the child was found four days later by a van driver who had stopped for an overnight rest in a layby on the lonely moorland road between Oldham and Halifax.Her body was in turf and heather behind the layby, half hidden by her bloodstained clothing.The jury was given 32-year-old black and white photographs of the scene, and of the Turf Hill estate in Rochdale where Lesley and Mr Castree lived in 1975.Mr Goose said that the 11 stab wounds in the child's back, chest and neck had been made with such force that the knife hilt or the killer's hand had caused bruising."This was a frenzied attack on a small, weak, 11-year-old child," he told the jury, who heard that Lesley was small for her age after ill health; she had had open-heart surgery, and she weighed only three stone (19kg). "The man who carried out those acts had a sexual interest in very young girls and, in a violent rage, killed Lesley Molseed. The prosecution says that he was Ronald Castree."The court heard that Mr Castree, who made regular notes in the dock yesterday, told police who arrested him within days of the DNA match: "I was threatened with this donkey's years ago." He allegedly added in an initial interview at Halifax police station: "I have been expecting this for years," but when this reply was read again to him by detectives, he reverted to "I was threatened with this years ago."Mr Goose said Mr Castree had denied abducting, sexually assaulting and killing Lesley from the start, and claimed in interviews that the DNA match was either cross-contamination of samples or a set-up by the police. He had told detectives that he had been assaulted by officers after suffering a burglary in 1979, and had made an official complaint. He alleged that this had led to threats that he would be "framed" for the Molseed murder. But Mr Goose called this "as illogical and absurd as it was false"; the idea that police would threaten to implicate someone at a time when the supposed murderer - Stefan Kiszko - had been convicted, when DNA analysis had not been invented and when the adhesive tapes evidence was at the Home Office, did not bear examination.The suspect's alibi about visiting his wife of the time in hospital, where she had given birth to another man's child, did not stand up.Mr Castree's conviction for abducting and assaulting the nine-year-old child was also important, said Mr Goose.That victim had been the same size as Lesley and went to the same special school for children with learning difficulties. "But she fought back, kicked Mr Castree and ran away from the derelict house where he had taken her."On the desolate moor where forensic scientists are certain she died, Lesley Molseed was not able to do the same.The hearing continues.
