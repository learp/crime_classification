Eighteen police officers were drafted in to investigate a vandalism attack on the home of former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin but without any success, it was revealed yesterday.The team included five detectives, forensic specialists and crime inspectors charged with investigating an email which claimed responsibility for the attack in which three windows were smashed at Goodwin's Edinburgh home and his Mercedes damaged. Lothian and Borders police spent 65 hours on the case.According to the email claiming responsibility, the March 25 attack was a response to public anger over bankers' role in the global economic crisis.Goodwin – dubbed "Fred the Shred" for his ruthless cost-cutting – came under fire for his £700,000-a-year pension. He took early retirement after RBS almost collapsed.The email said: "We are angry that rich people, like him, are paying themselves a huge amount of money, and living in luxury, while ordinary people are made unemployed, destitute and homeless. This is a crime. Bank bosses should be jailed. This is just the beginning."A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police said: "When it was confirmed that there was no immediate risk to any individual, the response was scaled down. All personal attack alarms or similar alarm calls are treated as a priority, irrespective of the address."The details on the scale of the operation were revealed under freedom of information legislation to the Edinburgh Evening News.Police have failed to identify those responsible for the attack.
