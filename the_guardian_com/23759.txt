Gerry Adams will undergo a fourth day of questioning by detectives over the 1972 murder of Jean McConville.Extra time granted to police to question the Sinn Féin president will expire later on Sunday.Amid a growing row over the arrest, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister said he believed it was part of an attempt by some police officers to settle old scores. Martin McGuinness blamed an "embittered rump" left over from before the reform of policing whom he claimed wanted to destroy the peace process.On Friday a judge allowed the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) a further 48 hours to hold Adams at Antrim police station. The republican party has warned it will review its support for the police if the veteran leader is charged.Adams, 65, denies allegations levelled by former republican colleagues that he ordered the murder and secret burial of McConville, a Belfast widow with 10 children, after she was wrongly accused of passing information to the security forces.Sinn Féin's decision to support the police in 2007 was viewed as a major milestone in the peace process and prompted the return to devolved rule at Stormont, with the republicans and the Democratic Unionists entering government together.Addressing a rally on Saturday in the staunchly republican Falls Road, McGuinness said: "We always knew that there remained with the PSNI an embittered rump of the old RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary]."They are what the reformers within the PSNI have described to us as the dark side. They are small in number but very influential. This group is working to a negative and anti-peace-process agenda."The Stormont first minister, Peter Robinson, the justice minister, David Ford, and Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, have defended the police's handling of the arrest and denied the action is politically motivated and designed to undermine Sinn Féin before the European elections.McConville was dragged screaming away from her children in the Divis flats in west Belfast by a gang of up to 12 men and women. She was interrogated, shot in the back of the head and secretly buried – becoming one of the "disappeared" victims of the Troubles. Her body was not found until 2003 on a beach in County Louth, 50 miles from her home.Adams is a former MP for West Belfast and now an elected representative for Co Louth in the Irish Dáil.
