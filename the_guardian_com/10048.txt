Thousands of criminals cut off their electronic tags across a nine-month period last year, it emerged yesterday.In a further embarrassment to the home secretary, John Reid, figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that in East Anglia alone 1,510 offenders ripped off their tags between April 1 2005 and December 31 2005.According to statistics released by the Home Office to the Eastern Daily Press, 2,555 offenders removed electronic devices in the same period in the East, London, West Midlands and Wales. The Home Office did not provide figures for other areas but confirmed 15.2% of offenders in England and Wales fitted with tags breached home detention curfews in 2005.David Davis, shadow home secretary, said it was "astonishing" that so many offenders had removed tags and it was "another damning failure of the criminal justice system under Labour. If someone is suitable to be let out on a tag, they should not be able to simply remove it."Serco has a five-year contract with the Home Office to operate the tagging system in these areas. "Overall, 85% of people wearing tags complete their curfew successfully without any breach of their conditions," said a spokesman. "You cannot remove a tag without cutting it off. If someone does cut off their tag, it triggers an alarm and immediate action is taken."Last September, Serco was criticised in a report by the inspectorate of probation regarding Peter Williams, 19, who murdered Marian Bates in her Nottingham jeweller's shop only days after removing his tag. An inquiry found that although he had repeatedly breached his curfew order, Serco failed to inform his youth offending team until the morning of the murder, by which time he had removed his tag.
