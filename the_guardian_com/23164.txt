A sexist and racially insensitive culture among police in south Manchester has been uncovered by government inspectors.The report by HM's inspectorate of constabulary found a male-dominated environment in which officers swapped sexist jokes and innuendos and, on occasion, showed a lack of respect for other races and cultures.Some officers in the south Manchester basic command unit dwelt too much on the race of suspects during brief ings and had poor knowledge of the Race Relations Act, according to the report. The inspection was carried out in May."The inspection team encountered a male-dominated culture," the inspectors reported."This was manifest by sexist jokes, sexual innuendo and banter and exclusionary language. This was compounded, on occasions, by a lack of sensitivity in relation to respecting dignity of others specifically with reference to rank/grade, race and culture."This was demonstrated on several occasions by the unnecessary reference to the racial origin of suspected offenders during briefings and inappropriate naming of a working group."Gordon Johnson, secretary of the Manchester branch of the Police Federation, said he was surprised by the report because the south Manchester division was one of the more modern in the force and had a number of gay officers.He said: "It is a concern because this is something we have been working to eradicate and feel that we have gone some way towards that."He said he could not recall any complaints of sexism or racism to the federation from officers within the division, and these issues were dealt with "very seriously".Yesterday Phil Hollowood, the chief superintendent of Greater Manchester police, said: "We welcomed the HMIC inspection as a health check at a time of significant change both for the division and the force. It provided a snapshot of the position in May this year."I was pleased to note the HMI found many examples of effective operations, that the majority of staff were high quality, energised and committed individuals and that there was a can-do culture."South Manchester is, as the HMI noted, one of the largest and busiest basic command units in England and Wales. We face the challenge of addressing serious gun and gang related crime at the same time as continuing to tackle volume crime. Additional detectives are being put in place to help in dealing with this balance."It is disappointing that the report does not concentrate solely on the facts and instead includes anecdotal evidence and reports perception as fact."The report was published in the aftermath of the arrest of Mark Daly, 28, an undercover BBC journalist who had been working as a probationary constable in Stockport, Greater Manchester.It is understood he has gathered "damning proof" of racism within the force. He was arrested this month on suspicion of fraud and criminal damage.In an interview with the Scotsman, Daly said the BBC had been fully justified in sanctioning the project.But the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Michael Todd, accused the BBC of gross misconduct. He wrote a letter of complaint to Greg Dyke, the corporation's director general.Other problems highlighted in the report included unproductive competition between officers from different subdivisions and a lack of clarity in leadership roles.The inspectorate recommended that a team from senior management prepare and implement relevant diversity strategies for the basic command unit.David Wilmot, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, admitted that the force was "institutionally racist" while giving evidence to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry in 1998.The unit will be revisited in May next year by the inspectorate to assess whether improvements have been made.
