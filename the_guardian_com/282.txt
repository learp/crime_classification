A carjacker who ran over a woman in her own car, dragging her nearly 65ft down the road and almost killing her, was jailed indefinitely for public protection .Kevin Richardson, 34, leapt into the car of Caroline Johnson, a mother with four children, while she was scraping ice from the windscreen outside her house in Langley, Berkshire, and drove off.Johnson was left with broken bones "almost too numerous to count" and will have to use a wheelchair for the foreseeable future.Only the prompt action of a passerby, who went to her aid, and the swift arrival of an ambulance, saved her life. Johnson needed a transfusion of 30 pints of blood and might never walk again, the court heard.Moments before he ran over her, Richardson was frothing at the mouth as he screamed at Johnson: "If you don't get out of the way, I'm going to fucking kill you."A fellow crack addict, Karen Napper, 34, had jumped into the car with Richardson, who stole the vehicle after spending the night in a drug den. Napper was sentenced to 16 months in prison.Sentencing the pair at Reading crown court, Judge Stephen John said: "This was a completely selfish and pointless offence with the gravest consequences for an utterly innocent, decent member of society. At the time of these offences, two worlds collided – that of an innocent family woman and that of two crack addicts concerned only with themselves."He said the pair were "bent only on getting crack cocaine" and that Richardson deliberately drove at Johnson.Richardson, who was living in Slough at the time of the incident, was convicted last month of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, having admitted lesser charges of aggravated vehicle-taking and dangerous driving.The judge told him he was being jailed indefinitely for public protection for the GBH charge and would not be considered for release until he had served at least seven and a half years. The judge said he might never be released if he failed to prove that he no longer posed a danger to the public.Richardson was also sentenced to 20 months for aggravated vehicle taking and 18 months for dangerous driving, to run concurrently.The court heard Richardson had a string of past convictions, including for GBH and common assault dating back to 1988.Napper, from Slough, had admitted a charge of aggravated vehicle-taking. Jurors had been directed to find her not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and grievous bodily harm. The pair were both disqualified from driving, Richardson for 10 years and Napper for two years.Johnson, who had stood over her car's bonnet in a bid to stop Richardson driving off, spoke of her relief after the sentencing. "It has been one year since the fateful morning that changed my life forever, but I am still here today and so grateful that justice has been done," she said."Now I can move on with my life and put this stressful episode behind me."Charles Ward-Jackson, prosecuting, said Johnson would be left with a permanent disability, even if an operation, due next month, gave her the use of her right leg again.Detective Inspector Steve Armstead, who led the investigation, commended her bravery."Caroline Johnson is a very brave woman who was not willing to just stand by and watch two people steal her car."Sadly, due to the actions of Kevin Richardson, she was seriously injured and is still suffering the consequences today."
