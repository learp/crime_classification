A morgue worker was jailed today for 16 weeks for stealing a dead man's belongings. Dudley magistrates court heard that Anita Lampitt took a mobile phone, a wallet and more than Â£220 in cash from a safe at the town's Russells Hall hospital last month. She was led away to abusive shouts from the public gallery. The 40-year-old, who said through her lawyer that her behaviour in taking items belonging to a road accident victim, Kevin Round, had been despicable, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to a single count of theft. The theft was discovered when undertakers asked for Round's belongings.
