The fugitive entrepreneur Ian Griffin, wanted in connection with the killing of his millionaire girlfriend, was attacked with a stun gun during a violent row in the couple's luxury Paris hotel suite, according to an ex-girlfriend.As police forces across the country continued the hunt for Griffin, the former girlfriend said he called her soon after the battered and naked body of Kinga Legg was discovered last week at the five-star Hotel Le Bristol."He sounded really upset and said she had attacked him with a stun gun disguised as a lipstick which she'd bought earlier in the day in Paris," Tracey Baker told The Times."He said he had cuts all over his arms and bruises all over his legs. That was the last time I spoke with him. His phones aren't working any more and I've been sending emails but I'm sure he's not reading them."Griffin, 39, and Legg, 36, were last seen together last Monday when the couple went out to restaurants and bars and later drank several bottles of champagne in their suite.The next day Legg, a Polish-born businesswoman who built a fortune selling fresh produce to supermarkets, was found battered to death in the bath and Griffin had disappeared, sparking an international manhunt led by French police and involving Interpol and British police forces.Baker, 28, appealed to Griffin to contact police. "I would say to him: 'Please come forward and tell everyone what really happened'. Put your side of the story."She told the newspaper Griffin had sent her a picture of his battered face after allegedly being attacked by Legg."I don't know what happened in Paris but I know he is not a violent or an aggressive man. I was with him for two and a half years and he never showed any kind of violence or aggression towards me," Baker added.Over the weekend, the black Porsche in which Griffin is thought to have driven back to the UK was found by police near his parents' house in Houghton Green, near Warrington.Police have searched the £5m rented mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, that he shared with Legg and it has emerged that last Wednesday he visited a marina on the Thames at Shepperton.Boatyard workers said he became agitated when he was told his boat would not be immediately ready. He tried to buy a motor cruiser instead, and purchased a marine satellite navigation system and charts covering British, Irish and European waters.Billy Leisengang, the administrator of Shepperton Marina, said he saw Griffin at around lunchtime on Wednesday."Later, when I heard about what happened in Paris, it was a great shock," he said. "They were very decent people, the sort of people we like to have here at the marina."Police are concerned that Griffin may consider taking his own life."If Ian Griffin is in the north-west, we would urge him to make contact with police, either in Cheshire or elsewhere in the region," a spokeswoman for Cheshire police said. Police sources said one unconfirmed report had located him in Shudehill in Manchester.An initial doctor's report found Legg had died from an internal haemorrhage and had suffered blows to the skull and body after being punched and hit with a lampstand.Legg transformed her family's farm in Opatówek, Poland, into an international business called Vegex selling tomatoes and vegetables to multinational companies including Tesco and McDonald's.She later moved to the UK and married Peter Legg, a council officer in Preston, Lancashire. The relationship broke down and she moved to Cheshire and became part of the county's well-heeled social set. In 2005 she met Griffin, who has run a string of companies, many of which have subsequently closed.
