The first attempt at a nationwide assessment of patterns of child sexual exploitation reveals that 26% of those who engage in grooming of children in the street are young Asian men.But Peter Davies, the director of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre (Ceop), which carried out the research, warned against jumping to conclusions on the ethnicity of offenders because the data gathered by his investigators was incomplete, not nationwide and of poor quality."I would send a note of caution about trying to extrapolate anything from this. Looking at this issue through the lens of ethnicity does not do the victims any favours," he said.The figures (pdf), published on Wednesday after a six-month assessment involving talking to police, social services and charities, revealed that of the 2,379 offenders identified by the research, ethnicity had not been recorded in 32% of cases.The data also showed 38% of offenders were white and a small number were black or Chinese.The data was so poor that reliable details of ethnicity were available only in 940 of the 2,379 cases.Of the 940, 26% of the offenders were recorded as Asian. The breakdown was 30 Pakistani, one Bangladeshi and 217 recorded as "Asian unknown", reflecting the poor quality of the data available.The report said: "We cannot draw national conclusions about ethnicity because the data is too inconsistent."Further research is needed to examine whether the ethnic breakdown reflects issues that need to be addressed within a community context, local demographics of the areas from which data is drawn, an unconscious bias among agency responses or other factors."The assessment was commissioned after national debate over what some people had identified as a pattern of Asian men operating in gangs to groom young white girls and sexually abuse them.Davies said the findings did not support this suggestion. He initiated the assessment to identify patterns of offending and victimisation and to improve responses.What emerged is that not enough is being done by police, social services and particularly local children's safeguarding boards to identify and investigate child sexual exploitation."The key message for me is that this is a horrific crime and involves the systematic, premeditated rape of children," he said."It needs to be understood, it needs to be brought out of the dark. There should be no hiding place anywhere for people who take part in this kind of crime."Davies said he was "surprised and disappointed" that two thirds of local safeguarding children's boards were failing to do their statutory duty on child sexual exploitation.He said they were required to assume that child sexual exploitation was going on in their area unless there was clear evidence otherwise. Only a third were doing this.Key findings of the research were that:• Most local children's safeguarding boards are failing to fulfil their statutory responsibility to identify child sexual exploitation and protect children.• The size and scale of the crime is not known.• Police forces across the country need to go out and look for the crime.• There are strong links between runaway children and victims of child sexual exploitation.• The crown prosecution service should carry out a review of all prosecutions to identify barriers to bringing perpetrators to justice.• More research is needed to provide a more comprehensive picture.From the data, Ceop was able to say 2,379 offenders were identified between March 2008 and January 2011.There were 2,083 victims, 90% of whom were white girls, with strong links between children disappearing from homes and the care system and becoming victims.Offenders were predominantly males aged 18-24 who acted alone or in groups.Investigators spent six months gathering intelligence and data from police forces, social services, health authorities and charities working with victims in an attempt to quantify the scale of the problem.Enver Solomon, head of policy at the Children's Society, which provided evidence to Ceop, said if patterns of perpetrators had emerged there needed to be further research but he warned against jumping to conclusions."This [ethnicity of perpetrators] is obviously disproportionate to the population, but the problem here is that the data is incomplete and poorly recorded so there are questions about the validity and accuracy of the data."We need to be cautious about drawing conclusions but if patterns are beginning to be identified we need to begin to understand them more, with more research so we can draw evidence-based conclusions rather than jump to any assumptions."Solomon said the figures represented "a scratching at the surface" of what was the hidden problem of vulnerable children being targeted, groomed, internally trafficked and subjected to extreme forms of sexual abuse and violence on British streets.The report identifies a strong link between children who run away, both from the family home and the care system, and those who are victims of men who target them on the streets, outside local takeaways, and at obvious local gathering points for young people, to groom and abuse them.The Ceop report, titled Out of Mind, Out of Sight, found that in 1,087 cases agencies had failed to identify the background of the child victim. In many cases no one bothered to record the gender of victims.Last year alone, charities dealt with 2,900 children who had been sexually exploited, according to figures released a fortnight ago.In 2010 alone, Barnardo's worked with 1,098 children who had been sexually exploited, a 4% increase on the year before.Davies, the head of Ceop, commissioned the assessment after a string of cases in the north of England appeared to suggest a pattern of Asian men grooming white girls on the street.He acted after two ringleaders of a group of Asian men were jailed in January. Mohammed Liaqat, 28 and Abid Saddique, 27, were convicted of raping and sexually abusing young girls aged between 12 and 18 in the Derby area.
