The care and treatment given to a man with a history of schizophrenia who killed a pensioner because voices in his head ordered him to attack a stranger have been severely criticised in a review.Martin Davies, 23, stabbed 66-year-old Gwen Poole to death as she walked to a skittles match in a south Wales village after being released from a mental health hospital.The review from the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales concluded the killing could have been prevented. It said there were "many shortcomings in the care and treatment of Davies and chances were missed in the weeks before he struck to readmit him to hospital".However, the report was particularly critical of the way Davies was discharged from a private mental health hospital six months before he killed Poole.It emerged that when he left the Cygnet hospital near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, he was driven back to south Wales, where he grew up and lived for most of his life, and left in the foyer of a homelessness office with his belongings.The report said: "We are particularly concerned with regard to the circumstances surrounding [Davies'] discharge from Cygnet hospital. The rationale for his discharge is questionable and the fact that health and social care staff accepted it was appropriate for a vulnerable young man who had spent more than a year detained in hospital to be discharged to a homelessness office is indefensible."Davies admitted killing Gwen Poole in March 2009 in the village of Llanbradach, Caerphilly. He is being detained indefinitely at a high-security hospital.Davies was admitted in August 2007 to Cygnet, with whom Gwent Healthcare NHS Trust had a contract to provide placements.The inspectorate report said that in July 2008 a risk assessment of Davies by nursing staff at Cygnet recorded his risk of violence to others as "significant".A further nursing report at Cygnet in September 2008 advised "the risks to himself and others would be extremely high if he were discharged into the community without an intense level of community support".Nevertheless he was discharged in October 2008 after a consultant ruled he showed "no evidence of schizophrenia". Later the same day he was placed by the Caerphilly homelessness team in a B&B hostel.The report said: "There was a great deal of evidence which indicated that in a crisis [Davies] was likely to harm himself or others. He had attempted suicide in the past and had repeatedly admitted to having auditory hallucinations. His psychotic symptoms were compounded by his alcohol and drug misuse."The inspectorate chief executive, Peter Higson, said: "Our review has highlighted many concerns in relation to the care and treatment provided over a period of many years. In particular, his discharge from hospital was not managed properly. His discharge was followed by a series of missed opportunities to provide better and more structured care."Cygnet Health Care said: "We accept the report's findings and in line with its recommendations we are already working with the Welsh statutory bodies to ensure that patient discharge planning is as rigorous and robust as we can possibly make it."
