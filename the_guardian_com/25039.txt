He will appear before magistrates in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.Police initially thought the siblings had had a row, but it later became clear that Ms Thomas was killed first and her brother was apparently shot dead when he returned to the manor house.

Their bodies were found hidden close to a cliff path near Littlehaven six days after their disappearance.
