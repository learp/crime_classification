A 19-year-old man has appeared in court on two charges related to an investigation into child sexual exploitation and abuse.Jake Ormerod, of Torquay, who was arrested on Thursday, appeared in Exeter crown court accused of offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 of engaging or inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity.The case was committed to the same court for a plea and directions hearing on 27 May. An application for bail was being heard in private.Detectives said on Thursday that their inquiry may involve 20 or more victims, mainly girls aged 12 and above in Torbay and Teignbridge in Devon. They are investigating whether the allegations are linked to social networking sites.The force wrote to thousands of parents of children at secondary schools in the area informing them of the investigation.But officers stressed that the allegations did not involve paedophiles snatching children off the street.Police said more arrests were expected as the inquiry into the suspected grooming of young people continued. The alleged offences range from indecent assault to rape over a two- to three-year period.Police and social services have interviewed 20 children so far from more than one school in the area.Detective Inspector Simon Snell, who is leading the inquiry, said there appeared to be "all manner of grooming taken place and it could well also be on the internet".The inquiry started last week after children approached child welfare agencies, which then alerted police.Snell said: "The complaints have been made by children.""It was raised at a multi-agency forum quite recently. We acted really, really quickly to make sure we listened to those multi-agency groups and have then conducted this investigation."We are looking at other people and other arrests may follow in the coming days and weeks."Snell said 50 officers were working on the investigation and the offences did not include prostitution. He said police had no evidence of images being involved but were keeping an open mind.Police could not confirm where the alleged abuse happened but said they wanted to make clear it was not in any of the schools in the area.Snell told parents that their children were safe to walk to and from school.Carol Tozer, director of children's services for Torbay council, said eight social workers were supporting the children who had been interviewed.She said no children had been taken into care as a result of the investigation, although two were already in care.In a plea to the community, Snell asked for people to come forward, and praised the bravery of those who already had."We cannot operate unless the community speak to us, so I hope that is the message I am getting out to the community and possible victims," he said."They can feel safe and come towards us now with any allegations in regards to child exploitation within Torbay. We will treat those allegations seriously and fully investigate them. We are going to make sure that child exploitation becomes a thing of the past in Torbay."Anyone with concerns of child exploitation in Torbay should call the police on 08452 777444 and quote Operation Mansfield.
