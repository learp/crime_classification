I know there is an article in this week's Spectator that has prompted a judge to refer the magazine to the attorney general for a possible contempt of court.Not being a member of the jury, I have read it. And I must say I am amazed that... no, on second thoughts perhaps I'd better stop there. I'd prefer to let the AG, Dominic Grieve, make up his mind about the judge's reference without clouding the issue further.I don't wish to end up standing alongside Rod Liddle in court, or anywhere for that matter.More positively, I urge those who have a copy of the magazine, which I suspect is many more than usual, to turn to page 50.Indeed, to paraphrase Mr Justice Treacy's admonition to the jury in the Stephen Lawrence murder trial, I'm not asking you to read it, I am directing you to read it.On that page you will find a review of the film Justice by Deborah Ross that is hugely readable, not least because it is not a review of the movie at all.Ross is, I am unashamed to say, one of my favourite newspaper and magazine writers. Doubtless, Meryl Streep will agree with me if she too reads the piece.
