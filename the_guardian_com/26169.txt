The disappearance of the businesswoman Carole Waugh is now being treated as murder by detectives at Scotland Yard.A 47-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of the 50-year-old's murder, the Metropolitan police said. The same man was first arrested as he arrived at Luton airport on a flight on Tuesday night, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and suspicion of kidnap.Waugh went missing after visiting her family in Durham over the Easter bank holiday weekend in April. Scotland Yard said the last confirmed sighting of Waugh was on 16 April in London. It is known that she spoke to her mother on the phone the next day. But after that, contact seems to have stopped.Her family reported her missing in early May. The case was handed to detectives from homicide and serious crime command of Scotland Yard 10 days ago. Within hours they realised her bank accounts had been the subject of high value suspicious fraudulent activity and appealed for information about her.It emerged last week that Waugh, whose family believed she was an executive in the oil industry in Libya, had perhaps had a mystery life as a high class escort in London. Police said that was one definitive line of inquiry in their hunt for Waugh, who has been missing for three months.Scotland Yard on Wednesday released pictures of valuable jewellery which has gone missing from her flat in Marylebone, London. The police have previously revealed that suspects in her disappearance tried to sell her flat and also defrauded her out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.Police have arrested 10 men and women in the investigation into Waugh's disappearance.Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane, leading the murder hunt, has appealed for information about Waugh's life in London.She had worked in Libya for the nationailised oil industry for eight years before returning to London. Originally from a mining village in County Durham, her family have made emotional appeals for information about her whereabouts.The announcement that the police were now engaged in a murder hunt will have confirmed their worst fears.Mcfarlane said: "Information has been received which has progressed this inquiry and we are now treating Carole's disappearance as a murder investigation."I am unable to go into further detail about the nature of the new information at this time, however, we now believe that Carole has not been seen alive since 16 April. Since that time, significant plundering of her estate has taken place to the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds."In addition to a number of fraudulent transactions associated with Carole's bank account there are also a number of her personal possessions that currently cannot be located."I am releasing images of items of Cartier jewellery, identical to that worn by Carole, which are amongst items missing from her personal possessions."The jewellery that is missing is as follows: a Cartier ring, a white gold bracelet; a yellow gold bracelet and a yellow gold necklace, which are all in the same style."Carole wore the jewellery regularly and I appeal to anyone may have been offered such jewellery or has any knowledge of its whereabouts to contact us with information."Anyone with information that can assist this investigation is urged to contact the incident room at Sutton on 020 8721 4205; if you wish to remain anonymous please call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
