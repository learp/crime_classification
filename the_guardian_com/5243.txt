Police and anti-violence groups called last night for tougher laws on deactivated firearms following Wilkinson's conviction.Realistic imitation firearms, such as the ones he bought, were banned last October under the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. But it is still legal to buy deactivated guns which, with the right knowledge, can be converted into live weapons.Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, unveiled plans at the start of the year to ban these types of guns, but ministers are still consulting on the matter.An outright ban would have repercussions for a number of legitimate organisations, including museums with collections of antique weapons.But Sue Fish, assistant chief constable for Nottinghamshire, called for swift action. "The law has changed [in relation to replica guns] and we are working with the government to ... tighten it up further. The home secretary has said she would be looking into further types of firearms which are currently legal and freely available. We are hopeful this will happen because it is a loophole that needs closing." She added that sentencing guidelines needed to be examined as they were geared towards rogue gun dealers and not those such as Wilkinson who mass produced weapons for the criminal market.As a result, she said, the Crown Prosecution Service chose to charge Wilkinson not with supply - which carries a maximum 10-year sentence - but with a harder to prove offence of intent to enable another person to endanger life, which carries life. Claudia Webbe, vice chairman of the Operation Trident Independent Advisory Group, which works with the Metropolitan police to tackle gun crime in London's black community, called for an outright ban on all potentially convertible weapons. She said: "We must make it impossible for someone to walk into a shop and buy a weapon that could be converted and used to injure anyone else."
