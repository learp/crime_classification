A woman who stalked the Little Britain star, David Walliams, for four years could face a "significant" prison sentence.Highbury Corner magistrates court, north London, heard how Sarah Bartholomew, 29, bombarded the actor with sexually explicit letters, her underwear, emails and gifts. She continued to contact Walliams even after being warned by police she faced jail, prosecutors said. Bartholomew, of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, pleaded guilty at a hearing last month to harassing Walliams between last October and February this year, and was released on bail. Her obsession began in 2004 when she was seen hanging around the BBC and outside his home, Kathryn Iyer, prosecuting, said. She started sending the comedian letters, many of them sexually explicit. After his solicitors ordered her to stop contacting him, she responded by sending emails to the lawyers and to Walliams's agent, Carl Hill. The messages became increasingly aggressive and sexual, the court was told. She was arrested on May 3 for witness intimidation after sending text messages to Hill. But within hours of being released from custody three days later, Bartholomew again sent messages to the agent.Today, Jonathan Steingold, defending, told the court: "My client has asked me to tell this court of her strong feelings for Mr Walliams. She has asked me specifically to impart that." Adjourning sentencing for psychiatric reports, the deputy district judge, David Miller, replied: "I think that she's made that quite clear on a number of occasions. I'm not sure it's going to help her." He also warned that if he had been passing sentence today, he would have given her a "significant" jail term.
