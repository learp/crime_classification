Detectives have DNA-tested suspects in the "Bible John" murder case in their latest attempt to catch the killer who stalked Glasgow dance halls in the late 60s.A number of men who were suspects in the original case have been asked to provide blood samples for DNA testing as part of the investigation into the murders of three women.Sources stressed that police were still some way from making a breakthrough.Bible John strangled Patricia Docker, 25, in February 1968. He murdered Jemima McDonald, 32, 18 months later and Helen Puttock, 29, 10 weeks after that.He met all his victims at dances at the Barrowland Ballroom in the east end of Glasgow and earned his nickname after he repeatedly quoted biblical passages.Hundreds of men were interviewed by detectives at the time of the crimes, but only a handful are understood to have been asked to give DNA tests. All are now in their late 50s or 60s.Although there is no longer a dedicated team working on the case, Glasgow detectives have never given up hope of catching him.
