Annual arrests of teenage girls and women have reached record levels, with more than 250,000 detained by the police according to the latest official figures.Ministry of Justice statistics published today show that last year youth offending teams dealt with 22% more crimes committed by girls aged 10 to 17, fuelling fears that a new "ladette culture" is emerging on Britain's streets.Youth Justice Board figures show that the number of personal violent attacks by girls dealt with by youth offending teams rose by 48% over the past five years, from 10,412 in 2003 to 15,413 by 2008. They also show sharp increases in the number of public order offences, up 37% to 5,852, and racially aggravated crimes, up 113% to 758, committed by girls under 18 over the same period.The report, Women and the Criminal Justice System, confirms the conventional view that women are less involved in crime than men but says the gap is now starting to narrow."The overall picture to emerge from the various statistics is that there is a degree of convergence between the sexes in less serious offending, but that males remain disproportionately involved in more serious crime," says the ministry's annual report by the Institute of Criminal Policy Research in London.The criminologists quote findings from the 2008 Home Office's offending, crime and justice survey showing that 26% of males under 25 admit they were involved in anti-social behaviour in the previous 12 months, compared with 17% of females. But the authors note that the 17% figure for females is up from 11% in the 2006 survey, while the 26% for males is unchanged. The peak age for girls' offending has fallen from 18 to 15 over the same period."It is possible that girls' willingness to admit offences has increased in tandem with society's expectations about their behaviour," say the criminologists.Further evidence that the gap between the sexes in relation to crime is beginning to narrow comes from the youth offending team figures. While the number of offences dealt with involving girls under 18 between 2004 and 2008 rose by 22%, the number of offences for teenage boys fell by 9%.The arrest figures of 251,000 women and girls in 2006/07 is an increase of 39,000 compared with five years before. Arrests of teenage girls aged 10 to 15 rose from 53,800 to 71,100 over the same period. The numbers dealt with by a caution or warning increased from 38,500 to 58,600 over the same period.A ministry spokesman stressed that young women only accounted for 21% of all crime and the figures were for the number of offences, not the number of young women involved."The Youth Justice Board has commissioned research into patterns of offending by young females, which is expected to be published in 2009," he said.The shadow justice secretary, Dominic Grieve, said ministers needed to get to grips with "this shocking trend".
