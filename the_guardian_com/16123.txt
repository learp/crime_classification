The man convicted of murdering the television presenter Jill Dando was refused bail today pending a second appeal in November.Barry George, 47, heard in June that the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) had referred his case to the court of appeal after "a thorough and intensive review".But at the court today, Mr Justice Treacy rejected an application for bail. George was not present for the ruling.Mr Justice Treacy heard from Jeffrey Samuels, who made the bail application, and Jonathan Laidlaw, who opposed it on behalf of the crown.He then announced: "I am not persuaded at this stage that this is one of those rare cases where I can take the view that I could order the release on bail because the appeal will be successful."He added: "I asked myself ... if there were exceptional circumstances that would drive me to the conclusion that justice could only be done by the granting of bail." The judge said he had answered that question in the negative and was refusing the application.Dando, 37, was shot dead on the doorstep of her home in Fulham, south-west London, in April 1999. She was best known for presenting the BBC news, as well as programmes including the travel show Holiday and the crime appeal series Crimewatch.George, who lived near her in Fulham, was given a life sentence in July 2001 after being found guilty of the killing on a majority verdict.The CCRC based its decision to refer the case back to appeal on fresh doubts about a piece of evidence that was crucial at the original trial: a tiny speck of firearms discharge found on the lining of an inner pocket of George's coat.It said the new information called into question the firearms discharge evidence used "and the significance attached to that evidence".The court of appeal dismissed George's first appeal against conviction, in July 2002, but lawyers acting for George launched a new attempt to clear him later that year.When it announced its decision, the CCRC said George's lawyers had put a large number of issues forward but these did not form the basis for the referral to the appeal court. The court will hear the case for three days, starting on November 5.The court is required to hear the appeal only on the grounds the commission has specified, but George can seek permission to argue additional points.
