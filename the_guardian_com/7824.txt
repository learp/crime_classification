Three detective sergeants who refused to give voluntary DNA samples for a national database have been forced to take desk jobs with Gloucestershire police force.The officers refused to take the tests for personal reasons, it emerged yesterday. They claim the decision to move them to desk jobs was a breach of their human rights. Voluntary DNA testing, costing Â£3m, was introduced in February across every police force to combat complications from contamination of crime scenes by officers' clothing, skin particles and hair. Gloucestershire police said that 700 officers had taken the mouth swab tests and 30 had refused. Of those, three were moved out of front line duties because they could contaminate crime scenes. Detective sergeant Rod Dally, chairman of Gloucestershire Police Federation, which is supporting the officers' stance, said the force's decision may be illegal. "The Gloucestershire force has one of the highest figures for obtaining samples from officers - but this is supposed to be totally voluntary," he said. "Sanctions have been taken against these officers. We have sought legal advice to see if the force's action is legal." Peter Todd, the assistant chief constable, said: "I have to make sure I protect the force and protect the public against identified risks and this is unfortunately an identified risk which I must protect investigations against." The Association of Chief Police Officers said the fear of some officers that their DNA profiles would be used for some purpose other than an elimination database was wholly unfounded. A Home Office spokesman said that after a slow start this year 40,000 officers had provided samples. The Home Office is confident the 75,000 target will be reached by April.
