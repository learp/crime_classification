A young woman was murdered by her husband and his mother because they thought she had brought disgrace on their Sikh family by seeking a divorce, a court heard yesterday.The body of Surjit Athwal, 27, who was last seen in 1998, has never been found but Michael Worsley QC, prosecuting, told the jury at the Old Bailey that she is believed to have been strangled.The disappearance of Ms Athwal, a Heathrow customs officer whose marriage in 1988 was arranged by her family, came to light only when relatives, previously too scared to say anything, finally went to the police after feeling "the prick of conscience".Her husband, Sukhdave Athwal, 42, and his mother, Bachan Athwal, 68, from Hayes, Middlesex, deny murder. They also deny conspiring with others to murder Ms Athwal in December 1998.The court heard that Ms Athwal had outraged her husband's family when she had an affair with another customs officer and began divorce proceedings."You can imagine the resentment that would have been capable of giving rise to in a family in whom close family bonds are regarded as desirable," said Mr Worsley.Having resolved that she had to "get rid" of her daughter-in-law, Bachan Athwal and her son lured her to India to attend a series of weddings. Pictures of her at the events were taken there. "Within a few days, she completely disappeared from the surface of the earth," said Mr Worsley. "The crown suggests the circumstances are enough to say, first, that she is dead and, second, that she didn't die of natural causes or disease or an accident, but died because she was killed, and in particular strangled."When Bachan Athwal returned she told close family members the truth, but told others that Ms Athwal had been strangled by her brother or by his friend. Mother and son also forged letters pretending to be from the Metropolitan police to their Indian counterparts to throw detectives off the scent, it was alleged.One of the letters said: "She was terrified of her father because Surjit's lifestyle is very modern, she cuts her hair short, smokes and drinks alcohol. He is a very violent man."Sukhdave Athwal claimed that Surjit was still alive and she had called him to say she had left him and was staying in India with a new lover, said Mr Worsley. He teamed up with his wife's brother, Jagdeesh Dhillon, to investigate her disappearance."This matter came to light as late as it did because some members of the family who knew the truth of what had happened were frightened," said Mr Worsley. "They were frightened that, if they told anybody, the same sort of thing might happen to them as they believed happened to the victim."It was not until some years after the initial investigation had been instituted that some of them had a prick to their conscience."Mr Athwal divorced his missing wife in 2001 and married again in 2004.The trial continues.
