Detectives investigating the murders of three women in Bradford said today that remains recovered from the river Aire by police divers on Saturday are not human.The remains, found on a stretch of the river close to Shipley Bridge weir, where the dismembered body of Suzanne Blamires was discovered last week, are thought to be animal waste from food preparation.Meanwhile, forensic tests on tools stashed in a large suitcase recovered from the muddy water in the same area, between offices and converted mills, are continuing.Officers are still searching along the river and at sites close to the red-light area where Blamires and Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth, two other women working as prostitutes, disappeared in the last year.West Yorkshire police's underwater unit is concentrating all its resources on the hunt, and has cancelled a series of training exercises which had been planned for June.Bouquets of flowers have been tied to railings above the river's dense banks in tribute to the victims.Stephen Griffiths, a 40-year-old criminology mature student, has been charged with murdering all three women, although so far only the body of 36-year-old Blamires has been found.At Bradford magistrates court, Griffiths gave his name as "the crossbow cannibal" â€“ a phrase used in media reports the previous day.He lived in a former wool mill converted to flats, close to the area where all three women were last seen, for 13 years. The building is sealed off and is the scene of intense activity by police, who have also been combing nearby roadworks and recent excavations made by utility companies.Blamires was last seen on 21 May, while Armitage, 31, has been missing since 26 April and Rushworth, 43, disappeared on 22 June last year.Griffiths, who was educated at the independent Queen Elizabeth grammar school in Wakefield, and at Leeds University, told locals he was studying criminology at Bradford University.
