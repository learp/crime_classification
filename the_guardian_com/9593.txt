A 39-year-old man was arrested yesterday after he was spotted tapping away at his laptop while perched on a wall outside a home in Chiswick, west London, by two police community support officers.The officers believed he was using the owner's unsecured wireless broadband connection without permission and he was arrested on suspicion of stealing the connection. He was taken to Chiswick police station and bailed until October pending further inquiries.Although wireless thieves say it is a victimless crime, the number of arrests for dishonestly obtaining free access under the Communications Act 2003 are rising.In April, a man was cautioned by police after neighbours spotted him in a car outside a house in Redditch, Worcestershire. In 2005, a west London man was fined Â£500 and sentenced to 12 months conditional discharge for hijacking a wireless broadband connection, in what was thought to be the first case of its kind.Detective Constable Mark Roberts, of the Metropolitan Police computer crime unit, said those illegally using unsecured broadband should fear arrest. "This arrest should act as a warning to anyone who thinks it is acceptable to illegally use other people's broadband," he said.Stephen George, a technology PR consultant, said that punishing every illegal user was unrealistic. "If police try and do that we will have more people in prison than out of it," he said. "If people want to stop others using their connection they can secure it in a few minutes. If they don't ... that's really their own fault."
