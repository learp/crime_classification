Teachers should be given more powers to search pupils they suspect of carrying knives, according to an independent report on the death of the Aberdeen schoolboy Bailey Gwynne, which goes on to recommend that the Scottish government explore tighter controls on buying weapons online.The multi-agency review of the circumstances leading up to the killing of the 16-year-old, who was fatally stabbed at Cults Academy, one of Scotland’s highest performing state schools, on 28 October 2015, also concluded that his death could have been avoided had those who knew that his killer carried weapons in school reported this to staff.Bailey Gwynne trial: boy, 16, found guilty of culpable homicide  In March a 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was cleared of Bailey’s murder but found guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide after a five-day trial at the high court in Aberdeen. He was sentenced to nine years in detention.Immediately after the trial, a Guardian investigation found that Amazon was selling age-restricted folding knives, similar to one used by the Bailey’s killer, without checking they were safely delivered to adults. The review report’s author, Andrew Lowe, told the Guardian he had conducted his own online searches and was shocked to discover how easy it was to buy weapons on Amazon in particular, and that there didn’t seem to be “any reliable age restrictions”. “Of course in the internet age it is difficult to impose resilient controls, but it should be possible to get together with these companies to agree particulars to protect young people,” he said.The report includes two recommendations for the Scottish government: that it should “explore the further legislative controls that can be brought to bear on the purchase of weapons online” and that it “give consideration to amending the law in relation to searching pupils”.Pupils can only be searched by senior staff if they consent to it, although schools can contact parents or police for assistance if the child refuses. Since 2007, headteachers in England have had the power to search pupils suspected of carrying weapons. The report also recommends that a “specific search and confiscation protocol” should be developed by Aberdeen city council and Police Scotland.On Tuesday morning, Police Scotland confirmed that 15 knives had been recovered from schools in Aberdeen in the period from Bailey’s death up until the end of August.An investigation for STV in August found that around 700 pupils had been excluded from Scottish schools for attacking pupils and teachers with weapons, including knives, over the past five years. The trial in March included testimony from four teenage witnesses who described how a disagreement over a biscuit swiftly escalated into a physical confrontation that resulted in Bailey being fatally stabbed.The jury heard that the killer had told police officers interviewing him the day after Bailey died that he regularly carried a knife to appear “cool”.The review was commissioned by Aberdeen city council, Police Scotland and NHS Grampian following the court case to establish whether there were “wider issues for the whole of Scotland”.It was led by Lowe, the independent chair of child and adult protection for Renfrewshire and a former director of social work, with a track record of involvement in high-profile investigations across the UK.How a 'moment of anger' led to tragic death of Bailey Gwynne Lowe, who also had to establish the relationship between Bailey and his killer prior to the stabbing, concluded that their altercation had been “an unplanned, spontaneous conflict that emerged rapidly out of an unexceptional banter. It is not considered that it could have been predicted or averted on the day.”However, Lowe added: “The course of the conflict was fatally altered by the possession of a bladed weapon by one of the boys. This was potentially predictable and avoidable if those who knew Child A carried weapons in school had reported this to staff.”Referring to media reports after the trial that Bailey’s killer had been involved in a previous incident in which he had allegedly thrown rocks at and injured a fellow pupil while at primary school, Lowe described this as having “marginal significance”.“It did not reveal a violent child, but a child under very significant and continual pressure from his brother,” said the report, before acknowledging that a complaint by the parents of the child injured at primary school had not been dealt with satisfactorily.The report includes a number of suggestions for how schools in Aberdeen can strengthen their policy on knives, including age-appropriate information for children as young as primary seven (aged between 10 and 12), notifying Police Scotland of “each and every” weapon-related incident and carrying out individual risk assessments on all young people known or suspected to carry offensive weapons. Based on one-to-one interviews with more than 40 people, the inquiry said the immediate aftermath of the stabbing “was well managed by all agencies”. Launching the report in Aberdeen on Tuesday morning, Lowe began by paying tribute to the dead boy’s family. The Aberdeen Chief Officers Group, which commissioned the report, confirmed that it would begin work on implementing all recommendations relating to them immediately, and likewise highlighted “the extraordinary dignity and fortitude” shown by Bailey’s family.Scotland’s justice minister, Michael Matheson, said the government would look at the conclusions of the review and report back in due course.
