Why is sentencing policy for England and Wales, and its impact on the prison population and prison places, stuck in such a depressing time-warp?Your leader column rightly questions the rationale for the "unambiguous, rapid and sustained" rise in the prison population, and "the desperate situation could get still worse, despite plans for 8,000 new prison places" (Prisons: Hitting the Buffers, January 26). If we are ever to escape chronic overcrowding of prisons, and panic measures in response, we have to find a better way of managing sentencing.My report for the Home Office in 2001, Making Punishments Work, showed incontrovertibly that the prison population up to then had risen, not because more offenders were being convicted and sentenced, nor because the same number of convicted offenders were committing more serious crimes, but because magistrates and judges had inexorably "upped the tariff" of sentencing, for broadly the same number of offenders, committing much the same mix of crimes. So, a larger proportion of a constant number of convicted offenders had been imprisoned, for longer. The further large increase in the prison population since 2001 is reported to have been for much the same reasons.The reason for this trend is obvious. Neither governments, nor magistrates, nor judges, wish to be pilloried for being soft on offenders. Who can blame magistrates and judges for choosing to respond to what they see as clear signals from parliament (through legislation), ministers (through policies and comments), and the media, by sending more offenders to prison, for longer periods?To change this trend, we do not need more "messages" from ministers or senior judges, but a more formal, open understanding between government and an independent sentencing authority about the guidelines within which judicial discretion in sentencing is to be used, and their expected impact on the size of the prison population.The nearest thing to an independent sentencing authority in England and Wales is the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC). My hope, in recommending a body of this sort, was that it would work towards a comprehensive set of guidelines, and that the relationship between guidelines and their expected effect on the prison population would then be a matter for an open dialogue with government.This approach requires a mature acceptance of the relationship between general guidelines and decisions in individual cases, which are rightly for magistrates and judges.So far, there is no sign of either the government or the SGC seeking to develop the sort of formal, open relationship outlined above. To create such a relationship, strong leadership and imagination will be needed on both sides. Surely, government can see that it is in its own interests to find a way to prevent recurrent crises that inevitably reflect badly on its own competence? And the SGC should see that, if it is unable to take on this more dynamic role, the case for an alternative authority will be strengthened.· John Halliday is author of the report, Making Punishments Work: A Review of the Sentencing Framework for England & Wales· If you wish to respond, at greater length than in a letter, to an article in which you have featured either directly or indirectly, email response@theguardian.com or write to Response, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.
