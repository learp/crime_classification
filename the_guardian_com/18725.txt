A former hospital cook today appeared in court accused of baking a fruitcake laced with rat poison for her husband.Yvonne Godwin is alleged to have baked the cake for her husband, Robert – to whom she has been married for 30 years – after discovering he was having an affair.The 56-year-old mother of five was remanded in custody for a fortnight by a judge at Gloucester crown court while forensic tests were carried out on the cake.Godwin, from Leckhampton, Cheltenham, is charged with attempting to administer poison to her husband with intent to "injure, aggravate or annoy". At a hearing before Cheltenham magistrates last week, the prosecution alleged that she had poisoned the cake after discovering her husband had been unfaithful. Godwin wept in the dock during today's hearing, in which Lisa Hennessey, prosecuting, said little progress could be made until the tests revealed which poison, if any, had been used. Judge Martin Picton said the issue in the case was whether Godwin had intended to administer poison to her husband rather than what substance was put into the cake, but agreed to an adjournment. As she was taken back to the cells, security officers had to intervene when an altercation flared up between two groups of relatives in the public gallery and outside the courtroom. Godwin - who will appear before the court again on April 2 - left her job as a cook at the Delancey Hospital, in Cheltenham, after developing cancer five years ago.
