Inspectors have refused to certify Nottinghamshire's police as an "effective and efficient" force in a report that suggests they are the worst in England and Wales.The report by HM inspector of constabulary, David Blakey, which was published yesterday, says the police performance was so poor last April "that if you lived, worked in or visited Notts, you were more likely to have a crime committed against you than anywhere else in the country". Despite a reorganisation plan put into effect by the chief constable, Steve Green, in the past year, the inspectors say there are key areas that still require urgent attention. The reorganisation was carried out at a time when Nottinghamshire was hit by a sharp rise in drug-related gun crime and an abnormal level of murders. The Home Office police standards unit is already "assisting the force in a number of areas". A further negative report could lead to Nottinghamshire becoming the first force to see direct intervention by the Home Office under the powers of a new police reform act. The report said Nottinghamshire had: 路 One of the lowest detection rates in the country 路 Insufficient staff in new control rooms, which had led to a huge decrease in the speed with which 999 calls were answered 路 Two sets of police officers turning up at the same incidents unaware that the other team had been sent 路 A record of taking from 24 to 48 hours for scenes of crime officers to attend burglaries. Mr Blakey said: "When the force performance was assessed at the end of the financial year 2002 it was one of the worst performing in the country. Following the reorganisation in April 2002, there was a fall in performance against national andlocal targets." The force had reclaimed that ground and in some cases substantially improved, but the inspectors refused to certify Nottinghamshire as an "effect-ive and efficient force". Mr Green defended the revamp. "I'm optimistic the crime rate will continue to fall."
