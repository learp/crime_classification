Hastings pier has been the heart of this wonderful historically rich fishing town for 138 years, but I never knew it existed until I was released from prison just over six years ago.Hastings was the nearest large town to the prison from which I was finally released after serving 20 years of my life sentence and it was there I decided to make my home.Those early days were filled with conflicting emotions, of happiness and guilt and occasionally I found myself suffering bouts of depression.To try to keep a clear perspective on my situation I began taking long walks along the beach, from the old fishing net huts situated by the town's famous Stade, all the way along to the pier.There I would walk its entire length and sit at its furthest point, gazing out over the windy Channel towards France.It was such a peaceful place. I'd stare out at the huge tankers en route to faraway places and between them and me fishing boats from the Hastings fleet would bob.I would imagine the lives of all those seafarers and wonder at their labour. The odd line fisherman would turn up and I remember being awed by their patience.Conversations taught me that as well as hoping for a catch, these individuals, like me, were just looking for some peace. Sometimes too, lovers would stroll by, hand in hand â€“ they might stop and stare like me across the foaming wild horses.The end of that pier was a wonderful place to find solace.When it closed down in 2006 many in the town were outraged. The letters page of the Hastings Observer was filled with angry words.Looking at the smouldering wreckage this morning was heartbreaking.There is anger in the town, but more than that there is an almost palpable sense of grief.Trail of disasters Seaside landmarks and their fates1994: Birnbeck, Weston-super-MareThe only pier that links to an island.
