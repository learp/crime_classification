I have killed the kids, the children are dead."In another conversation with the officer, she is alleged to have said: "I stabbed them with knives from the kitchen. This is terrible. At least the children are safe now, nobody else can hurt them."She later denied saying those things, the court heard.Farmer said that Kumari-Baker took her daughters on a shopping trip to the Lakeside centre near Thurrock, Essex, and then killed them as they slept at her home with a knife she had bought at a local Asda store.Davina was stabbed 39 times in a frenzied attack, Farmer told the jury. Kumari-Baker then assaulted her younger daughter in similar fashion, the court heard.After killing the children, Farmer said Kumari-Baker dressed herself and went out twice in her car before ringing the special constable.The hearing continues.
