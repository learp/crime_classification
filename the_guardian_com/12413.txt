Police are investigating an alleged break-in at the Houses of Parliament, with the investigation believed to be focusing on the offices used by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband.Scotland Yard received reports shortly before 7pm on Friday of a forced entry to the premises in the Norman Shaw buildings, which were the force's own headquarters until 1967.It is understood that a member of Miliband's staff found that a door had been forced but it is unclear whether anything was missing from the room.A Labour spokesman said: "There is an ongoing police investigation. It would be inappropriate to comment."The incident is not thought to involve the large office used by Miliband – who was not present at the time, having attended a party conference in the Midlands – but on the suite of offices used by his staff.Police forensic teams were believed to be examining the rooms on Saturday for clues to the break-in. News reports speculated the burglary may have been the work of pranksters or political opponents.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "Police were contacted at 6.55pm regarding an alleged forced entry to an office in the Palace of Westminster. Inquiries continue."
