Employers, landlords and leisure centre managers are among the people Scottish police can tell where a convicted sex offender is living under proposals unveiled yesterday.The move by the Scottish executive follows the murder of Glasgow schoolboy Mark Cummings by a convicted paedophile living near the boy's home.It stops short of telling communities about the presence of a sex offender - a so-called Mark's law - but human rights organisations say they believe it could still lead to vigilantism. The proposals are backed by the Scottish National party, but not the Conservatives.
