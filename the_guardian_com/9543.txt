One of Britain's "most feared and revered organised criminals", who made so much money he was able to retire at the age of 35, was jailed today for seven years after admitting money-laundering charges.Terry Adams, 52, from a notorious London-based organised crime family, pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to launder his income from crime between 1997 and 2003.He admitted the offences under a deal which meant his wife, Ruth, who also faced charges, was allowed to go free.On sentencing, Judge Timothy Pontius said Adams had a "fertile, cunning and imaginative mind capable of sophisticated, complex and dishonest financial manipulation".Presenting the prosecution's case at the Old Bailey earlier today, Andrew Mitchell QC said the charges related to conspiracy to launder £1m, but this represented just the "tip of the iceberg" of Adams's vast estate.Adams and his family flew first class around the world, stayed in the top hotels and had a passion for expensive jewellery, Mr Mitchell said.His daughter was educated privately and, when the family mansion in Finchley, north London, was raided by police they found half a million pounds' worth of art and antiques, almost £60,000 in cash in a shoe box in the attic, and jewellery costing £48,000.Yet while Adams's total worth was estimated to be anywhere between £3m and £11m, he had no formal work history and was paying no tax or national insurance, Mr Mitchell said."It is suggested that Terrence Adams was one of the country's most feared and revered organised criminals," the lawyer told the court."He comes with a pedigree, as one of a family whose name had a currency all of its own in the underworld."Adams was able to avoid conviction for years by keeping away from the direct end of the business, Mr Mitchell explained."A hallmark of his career was his ability to keep his evidential distance from any of the violence and other crime from which he undoubtedly profited," he said."By the early 1990s he had been so successful that he was able to retire, content that the wealth and status he had accumulated by the age of 35 would allow him and his family to live in the manner they were accustomed to for the rest of their lives."Adams had "always thought he was above the law and his attitude to this prosecution is some proof of that", he added.Adams was charged in May 2003, but a year later he was allowed to sack his solicitors and apply for new ones. He then applied for transcripts of 21 months of his bugged conversations at a cost of £2.7m.In March 2005 he pleaded not guilty, but the trial nine months later was put off after Adams claimed he found a listening device in his sofa. Plea bargaining began in January last year, but his legal aid was again transferred to new solicitors.He later delayed the case by consulting psychiatrists about his mental health, before pleading guilty last month.Mr Mitchell said Adams had "been able to maintain his lifestyle without the need to demonstrate any visible means of support", in part by placing his money in the hands of other parties and nominees.When his tax status was investigated, Mr Mitchell said, Adams claimed to be a consultant for a series of sham companies, but was unable to say where his office was located or give its phone number.He is being sentenced along with Joanna Barnes, 38, from Finchley, north London, the widow of one of Adams's murdered associates. She was said to be a minor player, who pleaded guilty to fraud involving a £15,000 loan.
