A man has been convicted of carrying out a string of sexual assaults on women in south London over 10 days, including the targeting of four women in just 24 hours.Mehdi Midani, of no fixed abode, was found guilty of six counts and admitted a seventh at Inner London crown court on Tuesday, the Metropolitan police said. The 28-year-old was also found guilty of common assault.The investigating officer, DC Tony Carr, from the Met’s sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command, said: “Midani caused enormous fear and distress to the local community as he carried out his spate of attacks, with four recorded in just one day.”As the number of incidents increased, officers launched a public appeal for help and information. Police stepped up patrols in the area and public safety advice was issued, encouraging women to be vigilant and take care in the area.The appeal resulted in information that led to Midani’s arrest on 2 November in the Brixton Hill area. He was subsequently charged.Carr said: “A public appeal was crucial to our investigation and led to information being provided that quickly led to Midani’s arrest. I would like to thank the local community for their support and help during our inquiry and hope they are reassured by the news that Midani has now been convicted and faces imprisonment.”Three other men, aged 30, 34 and 32, were also arrested as part of the investigation but were later released, with no action taken against them.Midani will be sentenced on 26 May.
