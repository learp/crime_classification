The urge to find a celebrity angle, however oblique, for every single news story, is, in some ways, understandable. Most people do, after all, like a little sparkle. But when it comes to reports of assault, rape and murder, there seems a strong case for this impulse to be curbed.Take the recent news stories about Kate Beagley, for instance, the young woman whose body was found on Monday morning. Reporting on this yesterday, the Sun started its story with the eye-poppingly extraneous detail that she was "murdered just yards from model Jerry Hall's £10m mansion".This came on the same day as reports about Alberto Izaga, the "insurance tycoon" suspected of battering his two-year-old daughter. Many of these stories mentioned that the crime occurred in an apartment block shared by "Frank Skinner and Carol Vorderman", while a Mirror reporter went on to note (in patter redolent of an estate agent) that this complex also has "a 24-hour concierge and state-of-the-art gym" and that "apartments there cost between £500,000 and £3m".The reason these details are included seems, of course, to be class. When it comes to crime reporting, there is still a deeply-ingrained - and possibly quite warranted - suspicion that the public is most interested in a certain type of victim/criminal: white, well-off, connected, "respectable". A reporter trying to attract readers to a story is bound to emphasise these qualities - hence the description of Izaga as a "tycoon" and the references to Beagley as a "career girl".Beagley was, indeed, pursuing a career (she was a manager for an energy firm), but, this being 2007 rather than 1957, that is hardly unusual for a woman. The aim of headlines such as the Express's "Murdered after a date, the happy, smiley career girl" seems to have been a simple attempt to underline Beagley's "respectability" - to emphasise that she is a woman worth caring about, and, by extension, worth reading about.Which, of course, she is. But there is a problem with an approach to reporting that implicitly divides the world into important and unimportant cases, deserving and undeserving victims, since it tends to obscure as much as it reveals about the true nature of crime.We can only hope for the day when all murder victims are treated as equally important - whether or not they were attacked within spitting distance of a celebrity's doorstep.
