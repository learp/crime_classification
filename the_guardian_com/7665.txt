The widow of Garry Newlove, who was kicked to death by a gang of teenagers, today branded British courts as "utterly disgraceful" in the way they treat victims of crime.Helen Newlove told MPs that families of victims were forgotten in the legal system and often left feeling angry and excluded from proceedings when they went to court.Speaking to the home affairs committee on policing in the 21st century, she said: "As victims in court, we want more help and respect. You go in the court with all the emotions, and then you are fighting for a seat. The press have a box, the legal people have a box, but there is no respect for the families."You do not know who you are sitting next to. I think it's utterly disgraceful because you think that the courts are for you, that they are your safety net."Garry, 47, was attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, in August last year after he went to remonstrate with youths who had damaged his wife's car. Three teenagers were later jailed for life for his murder.Newlove, who witnessed the attack on her husband, called for higher visibility policing in the battle against Britain's "yob culture", saying more resources were needed to stamp out antisocial behaviour before it got out of control."I believe that children did know that the police would not come out for minor crimes and I think they (the police) should, because criminal damage started that night and it ended up with the murder of Garry."She also warned against the closure of local police stations. "You cannot have a central police station with people bogged down with paperwork. You have to have somebody in the community," she said.Newlove has joined forces with other women who have felt the impact of violence in Britain and is acting as an adviser to the Conservative party on how to improve the court experience for victims, relatives and witnesses."Enough is enough," she said. "We have been through so much together as families. We feel if we get together, we may get something done."Newlove has suggested parents be forced to do community service alongside their convicted children; an idea that has won the support of Caroline Spelman, the Tory party chairman.
