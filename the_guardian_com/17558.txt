The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, last night called upon MPs to exercise restraint and avoid introducing kneejerk tough sentencing legislation in reaction to popular outrage over particular offences.Britain's most senior judge said the new sentencing guidelines council, which will set down the going rate for more than 2,000 of the most common offences, will also make it clear that not all violent criminals should be sent to prison.Its work will produce the first comprehensive criminal code for England and Wales.Lord Woolf told the Commons home affairs select committee yesterday that more work had to be done to persuade the public that community punishments such as electronic tagging - for both non-violent and some violent offenders - were viable alternatives to imprisonment.He said all requests to the council from the home secretary, David Blunkett, to change its guidance would be published. Lord Woolf said the sentencing guidelines council would not be "dominated by what will satisfy the public clamour" for longer sentences but would take into account the victim and the need to protect the public.He hoped that the council, which is made up of judges, senior police officers and victims' representatives, would take away some of the political controversy over sentencing. MPs on the home affairs select committee are to be consulted."Sometimes parliament feels it is essential to react to public outrage about a particular offence and wants the punishment to be very serious indeed," Lord Woolf told MPs. He hoped the new criminal code would mean that "parliament will be more restrained and leave it to the sentencing guidelines council, because there have been instances where legislating in haste has not necessarily been the most constructive way of dealing with the situation."He said he was mindful of the record prison population and understood that public confidence that justice was being done was critical. The key to it was to show the public there were alternatives to jail.
