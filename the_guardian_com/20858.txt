A man has been arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and making threats to kill after an all-day stand-off with armed police at a factory in Merseyside.Bomb squad officers and fire and ambulance crews were called to Alfred Knight metal works in St Helens shortly before midday after a man acting suspiciously entered the factory.Staff fled the factory, a converted suburban house, and people from neighbouring businesses and houses were evacuated to a nearby college.Merseyside police confirmed that a 28-year-old man, believed to originate from central Africa, was arrested after making threats. A spokesman said he was also thought to be in possession of a suspicious package. Superintendent Peter Edge said: "No one has been injured during the incident and the site will remain cordoned off until a search of the premises has been completed. The man remains in police custody and is currently being questioned by detectives."Edge said the man was contained in the building and trained negotiators were called in to speak to him.Although the man was detained on suspicion of false imprisonment, police would not be drawn on whether the suspect took a hostage at the premises, which carries out weighting, sampling and analysis for the commodity trade.Earlier in the day, Gaynor Tomlinson, who lives near the factory, said a policeman outside her house told her the suspect entered the works with explosives "strapped to his back".Major traffic disruption was caused by road closures around the factory. Dozens of police officers stationed at points near the factory blocked roads and paths leading into a 250-yard cordon zone.Bomb disposal teams from the Royal Logistics Corps were seen leaving the area along with police cars and ambulances.
