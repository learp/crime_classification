A drama teacher has been jailed for three years for encouraging pupils to have sex and betraying their trust in him as a source of friendly advice.William Drury, 48, was told by a judge that he exploited the teenagers for his own purposes, eventually assaulting one girl and taking indecent photographs of others.Leeds crown court heard that he told a 17-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl that they "looked beautiful" when they had sex in the back of his car as he drove them home. The married father-of-two was arrested after pupils saw pictures on his computer.He was cleared on one count of causing a child to engage in sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, but convicted on two similar charges. He was also found guilty of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, of three counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child and six counts of making indecent photographs of a child.The court was told that Drury, from Halifax, had discussed personal and sexual matters with a teenage boy "as a friend" but had become infatuated with one of a number of vulnerable girl pupils who sought his advice. Passing sentence, Judge James Spencer QC told him: "You became a teacher and you showed some talent at it but, from start to finish, you used it for your own purposes so you could exploit the children in your care."You did not maintain the boundaries which you should have done. You eroded those boundaries, you took advantage of your pupils' respect for you. It is that breach of trust that makes your case so serious."Drury was of previous good character but the judge said that a prison sentence was inevitable "so that you know and others know that this kind of irresponsibility and abuse of children will not be tolerated".Det Sgt Kirsty Walsh of West Yorkshire police, who was commended by the judge for her work in the case, said after the hearing: "As a teacher, Drury had a responsibility for the welfare and safety of the young people in his care. Instead, he chose to abuse his position of trust for his own sexual gratification."We hope the fact he has now been brought to justice will go some way towards helping his victims and their families to deal with the trauma his selfish actions have caused them."
