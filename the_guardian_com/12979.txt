The Independent Police Complaints Commission has identified "collective and organisational failings" in the Metropolitan police's treatment of a teenager who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend after telling them she feared for her life.Arsema Dawit, 15, was stabbed to death close to her home near Waterloo station by Thomas Nugusse on 2 June 2008. The couple met at church and dated, but after Dawit ended the relationship Nugusse became obsessed and threatened to kill her.Nugusse, who was 22 at the time, confessed to Dawit's murder in a 999 call. After his arrest, he twice tried to kill himself, leaving him brain-damaged and unable to enter a plea. He was convicted in May last year.On 30 April 2008 – six weeks before her murder – Dawit, her cousin and her mother went to Kennington police station in south London to report Nugusse's threats and to tell them he had attacked Dawit at a McDonald's restaurant in Walworth Road.In its report, published today, the IPCC said there had been "collective and organisational failings" in the handling of Dawit's allegations, adding: "Tragically through omission, misunderstanding and assumption, the messages and information given by the family on the night of 30 April were not sufficiently acted upon."The investigation focused on the actions of an inspector, a detective inspector, a detective constable and a station receptionist. It found that the receptionist failed to tell a senior officer that a threat to kill had been made, to record contact details for Dawit's cousin or to arrange for mobile phones to be seized as evidence.Nor did the detective constable who looked into the complaint "conduct a timely and effective investigation". According to the IPCC, "a culmination of leave, other work commitments and a reliance on a schools officer to make contact with Ms Dawit, meant progress by the detective constable was slow."But the report did not find anyone involved responsible for Dawit's death.The IPCC commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: "While our investigation has found that a station receptionist and a detective constable could have done more, neither were responsible for what happened to Miss Dawit."Cerfontyne said she was concerned by the heavy workload of the inspectors interviewed in the course of the investigation, especially "the almost unmanageable volume of work some supervisors are responsible for and the risk it creates of cases falling through the net."She added: "However, I am encouraged by the fact that the Metropolitan police service has conducted its own critical incident review of the case, which resulted in eight recommendations, including a review of available supervision resources. I believe these recommendations go a long way to ensure incidents like these do not happen again."The IPCC said the station receptionist had received "management action together with a development plan regarding work performance", while the detective constable had been spoken to by a senior officer and "given a number of learning points to take forward".The inspector and detective inspector involved were found to have acted appropriately.Solicitors for Dawit's mother, Tsehaynesh Medihani, said she was disappointed with the contents of the report and did not believe it had gone far enough in examining the facts behind the failings.She is to bring a claim against the police for negligence and will use a judicial review to challenge the coroner's decision not to hold an inquest into the death.The Met, which described the murder as "a tragic loss", said it had learned from the IPCC's investigation."As the IPCC report has found, neither of the staff investigated were responsible for what happened to Arsema Dawit, but there was organisational learning from the incidents prior to her death," said a spokesman. "We welcome the recommendations from the IPCC and have incorporated the learning into our development programme."A string of high-profile cases has left Scotland Yard facing accusations that it sometimes fails to take warnings seriously. Last year it emerged that John Worboys, a London taxi driver, had been left free to attack hundreds of women because officers did not believe victims' reports of being assaulted.Weeks after Worboys was jailed, Kirk Reid was convicted of more than 20 attacks, including two rapes. He had apparently come to the police's attention 12 times before he was arrested and charged.
