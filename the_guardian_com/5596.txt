Inquiries into allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile could be extended to more hospitals after police uncovered new information relating to the BBC star, the health secretary has said.Investigations are under way at 13 hospital trusts – including Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General Infirmary – but Jeremy Hunt said new inquiries could be launched after the Metropolitan police found "further relevant information" about Savile.In a written statement to parliament, Jeremy Hunt said he had asked the Met to review its evidence to see whether any of the information it held "related to health and care settings".He added: "The review is still ongoing. We understand the material includes information about hospitals where investigations are already under way and reference to other hospitals. Once this review is complete, the information will be passed on to the relevant trusts or investigations as quickly as possible."Once the information had been passed on, said Hunt, he would make another statement naming any other hospitals involved in investigations.The health secretary also said that although the 13 current investigations were on schedule, the discovery of new information meant the final reports would be delayed."It is vital that the final NHS investigation reports are thorough and complete and reflect all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending," he said, adding that the final reports were now expected in June 2014 – or sooner, if possible.Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is believed to have abused hundreds of children. He had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.The wave of allegations made against him sparked the launch of the Operation Yewtree police investigation, which is also looking into claims about others linked to him as well as separate allegations about a number of high-profile figures.Lesley McLean, divisional manager for Victim Support in West Yorkshire, said: "Victims have shown a great deal of courage in coming forward to report dreadful experiences from many years ago. Victim Support staff and volunteers in West Yorkshire have been working closely with some of those affected by Savile's criminal activities, and have heard distressing and disturbing accounts of what happened to them."Reliving past abuses can be extremely traumatic for victims, who have had to cope with these events for many years. While getting to the truth of what happened is important, we continue to make sure that victims come first, and are given the emotional support they need as this investigation progresses."
