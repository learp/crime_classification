Deaths in prison cannot be looked at separately from harsh and impoverished prison conditions, isolation and poor medical care, all of which have implications for people's mental and physical health (Death in prison: hidden toll of a justice system in crisis, January 21).At Inquest, where we work with the families of those who have died in prison as a result of suicide, neglect or brutality, our frustration and anger is with the lack of accountability following these death that results in the same systemic failings and the lessons not being learnt. Until there is a fundamental review of the use of prison for some of the most vulnerable and marginalised, prison deaths will continue.Deborah Coles and Helen ShawCo-directors, Inquest A far greater reduction in the numbers of people with mental health problems in prison could be achieved if a greater emphasis was placed on providing effective support in the community for low-level offenders with mental health problems and multiple needs. Such offenders all too often fall through the gap of traditional services and, without the necessary support, many end up homeless, misusing drugs and alcohol, and ultimately reoffending.Murray BenhamRevolving Doors Agency Many of society's ills result from children who lack the love and attention of a father. Suzi Leather obviously disagrees (No need for fathers in IVF treatment, January 21)) But there's a simple way to settle the matter: delve further into the backgrounds of the 101 inmates who took their lives in prison last year. If the majority who died originated from homes with two loving parents, then Leather may have a point. If not, then I'd say the current restrictions on who gets IVF treatment should remain.Christine KeatsLondon I have no sympathy whatsoever for those inmates who took their own lives in prison in 2003, whom you refer to as "victims of despair". The majority of these people were in prison for serious crimes such as murder, rape and child abuse. Put simply, if they can't do the time, then they shouldn't do the crime.Christopher WilliamsBristol
