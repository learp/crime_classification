A police officer was convicted today of dangerous driving after reaching "eye-watering" speeds of up to 159mph in an unmarked police car.PC Mark Milton, of Telford, Shropshire, was given an absolute discharge after he was told by district judge Peter Wallis that he had suffered enough after two-and-a-half years of court proceedings.Milton, an armed response officer, was convicted at Ludlow magistrates' court following a second trial after he was acquitted of the same offence last year. A high court ruling earlier this year had overturned his acquittal and ordered a retrial.The 38-year-old traffic officer for West Mercia police had consistently denied the charges. In a statement under caution to investigating officers, which was later read out in court, Milton said he had taken an advanced driving course and was trying to hone his skills.During the trial, Inspector David McWilliam, based at Telford police station with Milton, said the constable had told him he was experimenting with the car as he had not driven it before. Insp McWilliam told the hearing: "He said to me 'I have no excuses, I was trying to see what the vehicle could do.'"Footage taken from the camera video fitted to a West Mercia police Vauxhall Vectra was shown at the trial. Milton was seen to be regularly travelling over 100mph on A-roads and up to 159mph on the M54 during the early hours of December 5 2003.Pat Sullivan, prosecuting, admitted there had been some dispute over the speeds the camera had recorded, but said: "The prosecution say broadly these [speeds] are accurate and we can use them as a guide. PC Milton was travelling at eye-watering speeds."Milton has worked for West Mercia police for more than 12 years and became an armed response officer in 1994.
