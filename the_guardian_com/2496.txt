Children's services at a council that came under fire over the death of a four-year-old boy beaten to death by his mother and stepfather have been branded inadequate by Ofsted.Daniel Pelka died of a head injury after a campaign of abuse by his mother, Magdelena Luczak, and his stepfather, former soldier Mariusz Krezolek, both of whom were jailed for a minimum of 30 years for his murder following a trial last year. Coventry city council has come under some scrutiny since the death in March 2012.A report published on Friday by Ofsted judged children's services to be "inadequate overall". The report comes after a three-week inspection by Ofsted earlier this year. Coventry city council said: "The report published today found that caseloads for social workers are too high. Although social work teams have been increased, a dramatic increase in workloads – 46% over the last two years – mean that caseloads remain too high."By the end of February 2014, social workers in Coventry were working with 4,529 children in the city – up from 3,085 in March 2013, the council said. George Duggins, the council's cabinet member for children and young people, promised a "rapid improvement in services" in light of the disappointing inspection.An additional £5.6m is being invested in the service, which will be spent mainly on creating more social work teams to deal with the huge increase of referrals, he said, adding: "There is no hiding from the fact that the report's overall findings are disappointing, but many of the problems we face, particularly in the front line of children's social care, is down to the fact of the unprecedented volume of work, which continues to increase."As the Ofsted report reflects, the findings are not a verdict on the staff, who are working extremely hard in the face of ever-increasing workloads, and their passion, commitment and dedication cannot be questioned."We have already responded to this challenge by adding another team of social workers and we have funding to add more as part of the additional £5.6m because as a council, safeguarding is one our highest priorities."
