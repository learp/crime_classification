A woman who claimed she was trapped at home in the UK by agoraphobia but in fact led a lavish globetrotting lifestyle has been jailed for falsely claiming benefits.Tracy Johnson, 52, told benefits staff that her condition meant she could not go outside while, in fact, she was visiting countries including India, the US and Argentina, where she worked as a tour guide.After Johnson was jailed for one year Crown Prosecution Service spokesman Andrew Penhale said the fraud was one of the worst prosecutors had come across. He said: "Tracy Johnson plotted a blatant fraud against the public purse. She used taxpayers' money to fund a lavish, globetrotting lifestyle, all the while exploiting a system designed to support society's most vulnerable citizens."Ms Johnson claimed more than £1,000 per month in benefit payments over five years, when in truth she was spending the majority of her time either travelling or working abroad."Not only did Ms Johnson travel the globe while claiming she was a prisoner in her own home, but she also ran her own tour guide company in South America and earned money working as a wedding photographer."Penhale said that in 2011, when she was claiming benefits, she wrote a book called Last Tango in Buenos Aires, detailing her experiences as an English woman living in Argentina."Making a false claim to suffer from anxiety, depression and agoraphobia undermines those who do genuinely suffer from these debilitating conditions. This is one of the worst examples of benefit fraud that we have seen."Earlier this month, a jury at Merthyr Tydfil crown court convicted Johnson of 13 charges committed between January 2008 and July 2012 including fraud, dishonestly making a false representation, and dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstancesProsecuting, Joanna James showed the jury several posts Johnson had made on social networking sites. One read: "I am one spoilt girl. Early lunch in the Himalaya Spa. Lunch here would be two weeks' wages in India." She described Buenos Aires as "magical – like a new lover".Her bank statements showed a six-month period where large sums of money were withdrawn from cash machines in Argentina but not a single transaction occurred back in the UK.Johnson claimed someone in the South American country had copied her card while she had remained bedridden at her mother's house in Builth Wells, mid Wales.
