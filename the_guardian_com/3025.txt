The Home Office has recently put together this interactive map of crime around England and Wales and you can look up your borough. We wanted the original info that it used to put the map together and have extracted all the data behind the interactive. It shows the major offences by borough and over time too. There's a lot here — you scroll right to go through years and different crimes. Can you produce something better than the government that tells us what you think is going on?DATA: Crime across the UK• Can you do something with this data?
