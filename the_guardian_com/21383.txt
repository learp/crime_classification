Police said that no arrests have been made and inquiries are continuing.One witness, who asked not to be named, told the Sutton Guardian: “It made me feel cold. It was really horrible.“I just got off the 164 bus, I saw a young boy laid on the floor. There were about three officers set about him.“Then all us a sudden a few minutes later it went a bit manic and bit mad. It must have been about 10 police cars that turned up. A rapid-response car and ambulance also turned up. That must have been about five minutes after.”
