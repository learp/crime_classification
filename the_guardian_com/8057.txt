Chris Grayling will aim to burnish his rightwing credentials as a tough justice secretary on Wednesday by promising fresh crackdowns on terrorists and an end to the use of "simple" cautions for repeat offenders.The new criminal justice and courts bill, published on Wednesday, contains a range of punitive measures to reform sentencing, create new offences and overhaul the operation of the courts.The punitive tone of the bill, which has been signed off by the new justice minister and former deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Simon Hughes, is demonstrated by its language.It calls for a "clampdown" on the most serious terrorism offences, a "crackdown" and "tough punishment" for criminals on the run and a "radical overhaul" of cautions. "I think hardworking taxpayers of this country would expect nothing less than tough punishment for offenders who try to beat the system," Hughes said of one of his new measures.It is expected to form a key part of the final batch of bills to be announced in the Queen's speech later this year after the European and local elections in May – and form part of the long runup to the general election in 2015.Conservatives and Liberal Democrats both fought the last election highlighting the fact that Labour created more than 4,000 new criminal offences while they were in office. The coalition resisted the temptation in its first year in office, with the number of new criminal offences falling from 712 in 2010 to 174 in 2011. But the number climbed to 292 in 2012 and has been rising since.The package, however, will not include the proposal for 100-year jail sentences that was trailed over Christmas in anticipation of an ongoing high court challenge to "whole life" terms.But ministers propose including life sentences for more terror offences, including weapons training for terrorist purposes, other training for terrorism and making or possessing explosives. These currently carry a maximum sentence of 14 years.Automatic early release for terrorists will be ended and only allowed at discretion of the parole board. An automatic "two strikes" mandatory life sentence would be introduced for a second terrorist conviction. These measures are expected to affect about 30 offenders a year.Grayling said the changes were being introduced to ensure that terrorists who commit "truly horrific crimes" face "the very toughest punishments".The shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, said: "This bill is more about David Cameron's weakness, pandering to his restless Tory backbenchers, than it is about ensuring the justice system delivers for hardworking people."The bill also targets criminals on the run. Prisoners who fail to surrender when recalled for breaching their release licences will face up to a further two years in jail for being "unlawfully at large". About 800 offenders a year could face prosecution under this new offence.Serious offenders and those convicted of, or cautioned for, a similar or the same offence in the previous two years will no longer be dealt with by a "simple" caution. Cautions will be banned in cases of possession of knives, supplying class A drugs, child prostitution and possession of child abuse images.Cautions in these cases and for repeat offenders will only be allowed if signed off by a senior police officer of the rank of superintendent or above. The Department of Justice expects the package to lead to 14,000 fewer cautions each year.The bill will also allow more than 750,000 low-level cases, such as TV licence evasion and road tax evasion, to be dealt with by a single magistrate rather than a bench of two or three.Certain summary, non-imprisonable offences will also considered by a single magistrate, supported by a legal adviser, away from traditional magistrates courtrooms. The aim is to improve efficiency and free up magistrates' time to adjudicate on more serious cases. In 2011, regulatory cases amounted to some 888,000 proceedings in the magistrates courts. The single magistrate process will only apply to uncontested cases or where the case can proceed in absence of the defendant. Those defendants will still be able to request a hearing in open court.Among other legal changes are plans to raise the upper age for jurors from 70 to 75, allowing more pensioners to take part in crown court trials.The legislation is also expected to include the legal powers to set up Grayling's first "secure college", a 320-place fortified school for persistent young offenders to be built in north-east England at a cost of £85m.The bill is being introduced before two other crime bills have had the chance to reach the statute book. Grayling's new bill even amends some of the provisions in his own offender rehabilitation bill, which has also yet to reach the statute book.The crime package is to be introduced into parliament on Wednesday but is designed to be carried over at the end of the Westminster year to try to maintain some momentum in an increasingly sparse coalition legislative programme.
