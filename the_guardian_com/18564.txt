A 14-year-old girl appeared in court today charged with stabbing to death a 45-year-old man who had been accused of sexual offences.The victim, a builder named Robert Daley according to reports, was found with fatal stab wounds to the chest at an address in Stockwell, south London, on Friday evening.The girl, dressed in a grey top and blue jeans and flanked by security guards, sat in the dock at Sutton youth court gazing around the courtroom.She was remanded in secure accommodation until 25 May, when the case is scheduled to be heard. One of her relatives, a number of whom were present in court, wept during the 15-minute hearing.The Crown Prosecution Service earlier confirmed a man called Robert Daley had been investigated over allegations of sexual offences but the case had been dropped.A spokeswoman said: "We considered the file earlier this month but there was insufficient evidence to charge him."Police said the victim, who has not yet been formally identified, died from stab wounds to the chest.An 18-year-old man arrested earlier in connection with the death has been bailed to return in May.An official at Croydon crown court said any bail application for the girl would take place at the Old Bailey.
