A woman was given a 15-month suspended jail sentence after a crash over the Christmas period which killed her partner's two young daughters.Marie Easter, 44, of St Clement, Norfolk, was driving the family to the cinema when she swerved off the A47 and into a ditch on 27 December 2012.Tamzin Portor, 10, and her seven-year-old sister, Jessica, suffered multiple injuries as the car overturned several times. The girls died after being taken to hospital, Norwich crown court heard.Their father, Alan Portor, suffered broken ribs, while his son suffered cuts and bruises.Easter, who was also injured in the crash, told police she swerved to avoid an oncoming car but witnesses said they had not seen any other vehicles in the area at the time.Norfolk police found that Jessica may not have been wearing a seatbelt and the rear tyres of the car had dangerously low treads and uneven pressure, making it hard to control the vehicle.Easter admitted two charges of causing death by careless driving and was sentenced on Friday for 15 months, Norfolk police said.Steve Matthews, from the force's serious collision investigation team, said: "This is a terribly sad case where families' lives have been torn apart by the deaths of two young girls."What began as a festive treat turned into a tragedy due to the careless driving of Easter."Other factors may have contributed to the severity of the collision, but ultimately Easter's driving was substandard and caused the sisters' deaths."I extend my sympathies to their families and friends as they begin another year without Tamzin and Jessica."He said the case highlighted the importance of using seatbelts."Whilst we cannot definitively say that Jessica was not wearing her seatbelt, it showed no signs of having been worn in the collision," Mr Matthews added."It is the responsibility of all drivers to ensure that any children in their vehicle are wearing their seatbelts."Their use cannot be emphasised enough - put quite simply, they save lives and should be put on as soon anyone gets into a vehicle."â€¢ This article was amended on 3 February 2014. The original wrongly stated that Marie Easter had been jailed for 15 months. This has been corrected.
