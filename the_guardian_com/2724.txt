The new Police.uk website, where users can view the number of crimes, including robberies, burglaries and violent crime at street level, could have a "dangerous" effect on house prices, according to one property specialist.Nigel Lewis, property analyst at Findaproperty.com, said: "On the face of it, online crime maps are a brilliant idea akin to the neighbourhood watch schemes launched during the 1980s, but they are also dangerous for the housing market."In the same way school catchment areas have skewed property markets around the UK and created 20% uplifts around good schools, so these maps could drive down prices in crime-stricken streets and postcodes."A 2004 study by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) found that more crime in a London neighbourhood means lower house prices. But according to the research, it is relatively minor anti-social but highly visible crimes like graffiti and vandalism that have the largest negative effects on house prices, because they are seen as signs of deeper problems of neighbourhood social disorder. They also induce people to leave and discourage potential homebuyers.In contrast, a higher incidence of burglary has in the past done nothing to depress prices, although publication of local burglary statistics on the new website could change this.Dr Steve Gibbons of the LSE found that a reduction in recorded crime of 10% adds around 1.7% to the selling price when compared with the average home in the average neighbourhood.However Nick Leeming, commercial director at property website Zoopla.co.uk, said the new service will "surprise the few who have not fully done their homework", but would not have a huge impact on house prices because "most people who are looking to buy are more than likely to have researched the area that they want to move to and have a good idea about the level of crime there". He added that "any information that helps the buyer, seller, renter or property professional make good property-related decisions is helpful".David Dalby, a director at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: "RICS welcomes any improved consumer information which allows homebuyers to make more informed decisions. However, taken out of context these crime statistics could have an effect on house prices."It's also worth remembering that information about local levels of crime is already available through environmental searches commissioned by conveyancers as part of the buying process, but only forms one of a huge number of factors taken into account by consumers when deciding where to live."Lindsay Cuthill from estate agency group Savills said he expects most buyers will now look at the website because it is so new and exciting. "But I hope as a housing agent that people will apply some measure of common sense to their buying decision. Crime is very low down the list of priorities â€“ I've never had a client ask about crime and security ahead of how many bedrooms a property has," he said.Cuthill added that people buying in urban areas should not expect to find many places that are crime free. "Different thieves tackle different areas, so more professional thieves will target affluent homes just as there is plenty of low-level crime in less privileged areas."Philip Jackson, director at Birmingham-based estate agent Maguire Jackson, said he was pleased about the crime statistics being online, but added: "Our inability to get their site working today hasn't allowed us to double-check on those fast-changing inner city areas where often downtown Beirut & upmarket Solihull type areas sit remarkably close."
