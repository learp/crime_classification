The Liberal Democrats will today describe the Conservatives as "the party of crime" as they seek to promote their own law and order credentials.Chris Huhne, the party's home affairs spokesman, will call the Tory record on law and order a "disgrace" in a keynote speech to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth.Huhne – who will spearhead an anti-Tory rebuttal unit to counter attack Conservative attempts to capture dozens of Lib Dem seats at the next election – will warn that a new Tory administration would mean a soaring number of offences.He will draw on Home Office statistics showing a 81% rise in recorded crime between 1979 and 1997, the last period of Conservative rule.During that time, violent crime increased by 164%, robbery by 405% and burglary by 86%, he will say. He will also claim similar rates of increase now would mean almost 4m more crimes a year."The Conservatives love to tell you they are the party of law and order. They are not. They are the party of crime," he will say."Their record in government was nothing short of a disgrace. A vote for the Tories is a vote for more crime. It is a vote for tried and tested policies, which don't work."Huhne was forced to removed a line from his draft speech which referred to William Hague as a "skinhead" in a swipe at the Conservatives' rightwing alliance in Europe.Danny Alexander, the chief of staff to the party leader, Nick Clegg, said this was to avoid distracting from the party's message with a discussion on the shadow foreign secretary's "haircut or drinking habits".His attack on the Conservative record on an area traditionally regarded as Tory territory comes with the Tories posing the main challenge in the vast majority of Lib Dem constituencies.Huhne, a party heavyweight who came a close second in the leadership race two years ago, is vulnerable, with a majority of 568 in his Eastleigh constituency.The Conservative party chairman, Eric Pickles, has launched a "love-bomb" strategy, trying to woo Lib Dem voters to the Tories by claiming there is little or no policy difference between the parties.A Guardian poll published today shows the Conservatives have extended their lead over Labour to 17 points, while the Lib Dems, who arrived for their annual conference as polling took place, are unchanged on 19%.Huhne tried to create clear water between his party and the Tories on a number of policies as he engaged in a sparring exercise with Pickles earlier today.He said there were major differences over issues ranging from human rights to the environment and Europe."It is quite an amazing bit of cheekiness from the Conservatives when they say there is only a sliver between us," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme."The Tory party is snuggling up to with a bunch of people in Europe who frankly are shameful. Their Czech allies deny that climate change is man-made at all ..."The Polish party is homophobic and the Latvian party actually celebrates Adolf Hitler's Waffen SS."Pickles accused Huhne of recycling "old Soviet smears against the Latvians" and insisted that marches backed by new Tory allies, the Fatherland and Freedom party, were not commemorating the Nazis but Latvian conscripts who died during the war."This is why people are turning off from the Liberal Democrats and why we want people who have voted Liberal Democrat to come home to the Conservatives," Pickles said."If you care deeply about liberal democracy, then the only party that is going to push it forward in government are the Conservatives."
