A loathing for paperwork and a reluctance to prosecute may sound like odd virtues in a senior police officer. Assistant chief constable Doug Paxton, however, takes the lead at the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in tackling bureaucracy. His force's policing initiative is handing back responsibility to front line officers, making more efficient use of their time and improving service to the public."[Police work] had become risk-averse, record keeping too elaborate and officers had been put in a position where their roles were too rigid to respond – particularly to pleas for help from the public."We had been clogging up the criminal justice system, resorting to prosecution of young people [for anti-social behaviour] when people were asking us to be more flexible, to spend less time filling in forms and more on problem-solving."Our initiative has been running for 18 months and so far we are really pleased with the results. We are putting fewer young people through the courts, and have seen a rise in the level of confidence in the police service – and a pleasing increase in staff saying they like working for Staffordshire police."Officers haven't necessarily had this freedom for some time. It takes a while for them to get used to using their own professional judgment."Zero tolerance of anti-social behaviour doesn't mean that everyone should be criminalised. People should write letters of apology or pay compensation. In our view that's what the public are asking for."In the future there are areas of service where we will need to be more pragmatic. It can't be a Rolls Royce service in all areas. There may have to be frank discussions with the public about stopping doing some things. Some specialist squads could, for example, be shared regionally between neighbouring forces. Allowing more decisions to be taken at a local level [would be good]."
