Was the emergency services' response adequate? The coroner will seek to establish what happened to those who were not killed instantly. Did the victims receive adequate treatment, and could a delay in arriving at the scenes or in transporting victims to hospital have contributed to the deaths?Was there enough medical equipment on the transport network? The hearing will examine if there were failings in the supply of first aid kits and medical equipment on trains or underground stations.Were there failures in communication? The inquests will look at the failings of telephones and radios above and below ground, and whether some information - such as the fact that power had been cut to tube lines - could have speeded up the rescue effort if more widely known earlier.Should the transport network have been shut down earlier? The last bomb, on the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square, was detonated almost an hour after the other three devices.Were the attacks preventable? It will consider whether the police and M15 fully examined intelligence linking the bombers to known terror suspects along with information, received in March 2005, that a man "Saddique" had received military training in a mujahideen camp in Pakistan four years earlier.The inquest will also examine forensic evidence relating to how the bombs were made, and about the lives of the four men prior to 7 July, including their upbringing, education and radicalisation.Pathological evidence on the nature of the injuries caused by close proximity to the explosion will also be presented to the coroner.But questions about the way in which victims were identified and their families informed - which has been the subject of concern among many of the families - will be examined in a separate report by the Metropolitan police.
