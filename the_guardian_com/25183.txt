A man was jailed yesterday for stealing and hoarding almost 300 birds' eggs.Magistrates heard that John Latham was involved in "obsessive trophy hunting". After raids on three properties, wildlife officers discovered 282 eggs, including 14 rare protected kingfisher eggs. Latham, a cabinet maker from Parr, St Helens, Merseyside, became only the seventh person in the country to be imprisoned for collecting eggs from the wild since the law changed in 2001. He was sentenced to three months' custody after pleading guilty at St Helens magistrates court to five offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Officers who raided his home believe he had many more eggs but managed to dispose of them before the raid. Investigating officer Chris Townend, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: "We found an eight-drawer cabinet made by Latham with labels which indicated he had been storing other eggs as well, including those from peregrine falcons and golden eagles." He said it was "obsessive trophy hunting" which did huge damage to rare species. The court heard that earlier this year Latham was fined Â£2,500 for committing similar offences in Orkney. Paula Grogan, prosecuting, said that officers had found documents and diaries which detailed visits to at least 61 nests over three months. Latham kept maps of the nest locations and photographs of what he found. Defence solicitor Frank Roe said that Latham had an obsession which was unsustainable. What had started as a hobby introduced to him by his father had spiralled out of control. Since his arrest Latham had been shunned by his family and "to the local community he will always be known as the egg man," Mr Roe said.
