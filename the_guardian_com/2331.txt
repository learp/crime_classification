Police today released CCTV footage of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor filmed just an hour before he was murdered.The video shows him making his way to an after-school computer class at the library in Cronin Street, Peckham, south-east London.Damilola, dressed in a distinctive silver padded jacket, is clearly seen hopping playfully between decorative stones and running along the lines in the paving of the square close to the library.The CCTV footage begins at 3.44pm last Monday. Just over an hour later, police found Damilola bleeding to death in the stairwell of West Hordle Promenade, a short distance from his home.At a Scotland Yard press briefing, Detective Superintendent David Dillnutt said: "When he arrived at the library, he was on his own, but there were a number of people in the area around the library and the square and the sports centre."Although a lot of people have helped us so far, more information is needed."We know he left the library at 4.25pm and walked across the square and across the front of the sports centre, but where did he go from there?"I would ask any children and adults, did they see Damilola? Did they see him talk to anyone? Did they see anyone attacking him?"However irrelevant you might think the information may be, please come forward."Mr Dillnutt said that speculation about the motives for the attack, including one theory that Damilola had been caught up in turf war between rival young crack-cocaine dealers, was "less than helpful".He added: "We are keeping an open mind. If people have any information then they should come forward."I'm hoping that, by releasing this CCTV footage, we can jog people's memories, that people will ask themselves did they see him in the streets nearby?"He said that detectives were still keen to interview a group of six to 10 boys, aged about 14, who were seen in the square near the library as Damilola left.Video footage of him leaving the building was not of sufficient quality to enable identification of the youths.Related storyPolice in Damilola inquiry seek gang of youthsRelated special report Policing crimeIn pictures Damilola Taylor's last journeyUseful linksMetropolitan policeLondon borough of SouthwarkLocal media: South London online
