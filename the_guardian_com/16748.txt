The royal family member who was alleged to have been blackmailed over gay sex claims was also accused of taking drugs, a court was told today.The Old Bailey heard the allegation from a News of the World journalist who was contacted by the two alleged blackmailers before they attempted to extort money from the royal himself.Ian Strachan and Sean McGuigan recorded hours of conversations with a former employee of the royal that included a series of lurid claims – most notably that the royal performed oral sex on him – the jury has heard.Today, James Weatherup, now the News of the World's assistant news editor, described how he was contacted by Strachan last year, when he was a reporter for the paper.Initial discussions were based around the behaviour of the former employee, known in court only as D, rather than the member of the extended royal family, referred to as A, Weatherup said."As the story developed we became more interested in A because Ian had said that A took drugs," he said."It's in the tapes. There is an allegation of taking drugs. We'd be interested in proving that A took drugs. We knew that D took drugs because it was on the tape."Strachan, 31, and 41-year-old McGuigan, both of south London, are alleged to have demanded £50,000 from the royal in return for handing over the video and audio recordings of D's claims.The pair were arrested at the Hilton hotel in Park Lane, central London, last September after meeting a man they believed was an associate of A, but who was an undercover policeman. Both men deny making an unwarranted demand with menaces with a view to gain.Later, in a robust and unusual exchange, Weatherup and McGuigan's lawyer debated whether D could be described as similar to John Inman's camp character from the TV sitcom Are You Being Served?, and whether this might have made him unattractive to his royal employer.D was "a little past his prime" and could hardly be considered "irresistible", Ronald Thwaites QC told the court.This was somewhat unfair, Weatherup responded, adding: "I felt that he was full of joie de vivre, entertaining and prepared to gossip on a regular basis about people that he worked for - the royal family."He added that D was "camp", prompting Thwaites to ask: "Would you say camp as that of John Inman in Are You Being Served? In that show, was that how he was cavorting himself around? He is hardly someone who sounds irresistible."Weatherup responded: "I thought he was quite entertaining."Thwaites asked the journalist what he thought was the likelihood, "on a scale of one to 100", of A wishing to carry out the sex act on D.Weatherup replied: "On the tape D says that the act happened and he says it on a number of occasions, completely separate on another day he says it again. He is consistent in his answers about what happened to D and A."The ex-employee, Thwaites told the court, appeared to be "a boastful braggart who is showing off to the nearest audience or to any audience, camping it up, mincing around, putting everyone down except himself".This was "a very harsh judgment on D", Weatherup said.Yesterday, the jury was told that Strachan and McGuigan made more than eight hours of audio and video recordings of D discussing claims about A, as well as making disparaging remarks about other royals.If published, the allegations had the potential to "cause embarrassment and hurt" to A and the wider royal family, the prosecutor, Mark Ellison QC, said.Ellison said Strachan and McGuigan tried for several months to sell the story to various tabloid newspapers, including the Sun and Sunday Express as well as the News of the World.
