Police have issued a photo of two men in a car after two teenage girls reported they were subjected to violent threats – including a reference to beheading – as they left an army reserve centre.The occupants of a silver Opel Zafira were thought to have asked “Are you in the army?”, then shouted as they drove past the cadets, who were not in uniform, after the girls left the centre in Alexandra Road, Gateshead.The alleged reference to beheading has chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby who was attacked in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013.Northumbria police have stepped up patrols in the area and warned other army reserve centres - formerly the Territorial Army - since the incident that happened at about 9.15pm on Wednesday 21 January.Police have traced the car, which is left-hand drive and appears to have foreign plates, and were trying to establish the identity of the occupants.The driver was described as black or Asian, in his 40s, and of plump or muscular build with a black bushy beard and wearing dark clothes.The passenger was also said to be black or Asian, in his 30s, and had short black hair and stubble.Gateshead superintendent, Richie Jackson, said: “The men made no attempt to make any physical contact with the girls or get out of the car, and shouted the comments while driving away from the scene.“Inquiries are ongoing to establish the exact nature of what was said during the incident and we have spoken to the two teenage girls, viewed CCTV footage from the area and have identified the vehicle and inquiries are ongoing to trace the driver.“As a precaution we have notified staff at other army reserve centres in the area and have had extra officers on patrol in Alexandra Road to reassure residents.“Although this is concerning, it is an isolated incident and if anyone has any information that could help us with the investigation I’d ask that they contact us on 101.”A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “We are aware of an incident allegedly involving members of the army cadet force – this is a matter for the police and we cannot comment further. Any witnesses are urged to contact the police.“We understand the girls were not in uniform at the time of the incident and that the suspects asked them ‘Are you in the army?’ before issuing the threats.”Fusilier Rigby was killed near the Royal Artillery barracks in Woolwich, while off duty.His killers, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, set about him with knives and a cleaver, hacking him to death. The pair were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in jail.
