A 24-year-old man was arrested today in connection with the death of skydiver Stephen Hilder, police said.The Leeds man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a separate offence of criminal damage, Humberside police said.Mr Hilder, 20, plunged 13,000ft to his death over Hibaldstow airfield, north Lincolnshire, on July 4, after his main and reserve parachutes were tampered with. The suspect was arrested at 8am today in Leeds and taken to Scunthorpe police station, where he was being interviewed by detectives.Mr Hilder's family has been made aware of the latest developments in the inquiry, a Humberside police spokesperson said. Two weeks ago, shortly after two 19-year-old men were arrested and later released on police bail pending further inquiries, detectives said they were speaking to members of Leeds University skydiving club who regularly use Hibaldstow Airfield. They said they had already spoken to some members of the club, but were revisiting West Yorkshire to speak to some of them again and to trace members of the club not yet spoken to. At the time, Detective Superintendent Colin Andrews, who heads the inquiry, said: "Because Hibaldstow is the most local drop zone for the Leeds club we are anxious to speak to all of the club members in case one of them recalls anything specific about the collegiate week and has not mentioned it to us previously." A spokeswoman said tonight she could not confirm whether the arrested man was a member of the club. She said no further details of the arrest would be released.
