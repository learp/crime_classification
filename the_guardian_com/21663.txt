The police officer leading the inquiry into the killing of Garry Newlove has today called for a ban on public drinking to tackle antisocial behaviour.Peter Fahy, the Cheshire chief constable, also said the legal age for drinking alcohol should be raised to 21 to reduce the problem of underage drinking. He added that drinking should only be allowed in public with the express permission of local councils."At the moment, you can drink anywhere you like in Great Britain in public unless the local authority have designated that you can't drink in that area," he said."I would actually like to see the emphasis changed the other way - that we actually say drinking in public is not permitted apart from in those areas where a local community, local authority says: 'Yes, in this particular park, this particular location, people can drink.'"It's that sort of thing which starts changing the popular culture, which starts getting the message across."Mr Fahy's call for a ban on public drinking - similar to the ban on smoking in public places, introduced this summer - follows the death of Mr Newlove, a 47-year-old father of three who was attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, last week.Three teenage boys were yesterday charged with his murder. A fourth, 18-year-old Adam Swellings, was charged today and is due to appear at Runcorn magistrates court.Following Mr Fahy's appeal for the legal drinking age to be raised to 21, the home office minister, Meg Hillier, said there were no plans to either raise the legal age or impose a public ban."If we raise the age to 21, it's not going to stop people," she said. "It would demonise or prevent a lot of adults who are drinking quite responsibly."Ms Hillier added that there were "no great plans" for a blanket ban on public drinking, and that it was up to local councils to decide what was appropriate in their areas.The minister said a review of licensing laws, due to be published in 2008, "may lead to some changes" in the availability of cheap alcohol, but added: "Who knows."She said alcohol-induced antisocial behaviour was "not something that government or legislation or the police alone can solve, it's much more of an attitude in society".Ms Hillier also blamed drunken celebrities for setting a bad example to young people. "I think those individuals need to recognise that their fame comes on the back of people of all ages buying their products and that they have a young fanbase; that's not a very sensible approach by them, but there's not much government can do," she said.The Conservative MP James Brokenshire also rejected the idea of raising the drinking age. "Just having a 21-year limit will not deal with the 11 and 12-year-olds who are binge drinking on a monthly basis and the 15 and 16-year-olds who are getting alcohol very freely," he said.Mr Brokenshire, the MP for Hornchurch, said highly visible community policing and the greater involvement of communities in deciding the operation of local licensing were the solution.However, he added that the government's relaxation of the licensing laws had exacerbated alcohol-fuelled violence. "Rather than getting the cafe culture they were promising, we are actually getting a violent crime culture," he said.Last month, a Home Office report revealed a 22% rise in alcohol-fuelled crime between 3am and 6am in the year after 24-hour licensing was introduced.There were 1,087,000 violent attacks by drunks in the first full year of the new law - up 64,000 on the previous year, the report revealed. The prime minister has ordered a review of the legislation.Alcohol Concern said Britain was "awash with cheap alcohol" and called on the government to consider higher taxes as a means of reducing its consumption among young people.A spokesman said: "We would urge the government to consider taxation as a means of reducing binge drinking and the antisocial behaviour associated with it. Higher taxes would disproportionately affect the young, who have limited incomes."The Wine & Spirit Trade Association (WTSA) said it was "too simplistic" to cite cheap alcohol as the cause of growing antisocial behaviour. Its chief executive, Jeremy Beadles, blamed underage drinking on "proxy purchasing" of alcohol by older friends, siblings and, occasionally, parents.The latest figures from the national statistics office show that alcohol is 65% more affordable than in was in 1980.The chief medical officer for England, Sir Liam Donaldson, has called for the tax on alcohol to be increased to reduce the damage caused to people's health and to deter excessive drinking. Yesterday, Mr Fahy said police were "engaged in a constant battle against antisocial behaviour and alcohol-induced violence". He blamed a hard core of parents who chose to turn a blind eye to their children's underage drinking and causing a nuisance to others.The three youths charged with Mr Newlove's murder - two aged 15 and a third aged 16, who cannot be identified for legal reasons - appeared at Runcorn youth court yesterday.Roger Allanson, defending the 15-year-olds, said both denied the charge. All three were remanded in local authority secure accommodation to appear at Warrington magistrates' court on August 20.Three other youths, one aged 16 and two aged 18, were also arrested yesterday and are helping police with their inquiries. All are from the Warrington area.
