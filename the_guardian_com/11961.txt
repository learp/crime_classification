The largest provider of forensic science to police forces in England and Wales will stop taking fresh casework at the start of next month. From then on, evidence from crime scenes will be handled exclusively by private companies or analysed by the police themselves.The closure of the Forensic Science Service draws a line under a company that has recently been losing the government more than £1m a month, but critics of the plan raise serious concerns over what they say amounts to a risky, nationwide experiment with the criminal justice system.The decision last December to close the FSS gave police forces and private forensics companies less than a year to draw up contracts and arrange for the transfer of thousands of cases from the service.Police forces made no secret of the immensity of the task. More than 60% of the forensic work ordered by the police in England and Wales – around 120,000 cases a year – was handled by the service.The hasty closure alarmed some MPs. An inquiry by the Commons science and technology committee condemned government for rushing the process and expressed shock at how little consideration was given to the wider impact of the move.Neither the government's chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, nor the Home Office chief scientist, Bernard Silverman, were consulted.The speed of the transition has led some experts to question whether private companies are well prepared to shoulder the fresh casework."To think you can refashion so much of the market and not have repercussions is simply daft," said a senior forensics specialist who worked at the Home Office but asked not to be named."All of the private companies are very competent, but this isn't tweaking the market, this is placing more than half of it on suppliers that are already facing heavy pressures."Private forensics companies, such as LGC Forensics in Middlesex and Orchid Cellmark in Oxfordshire, are rapidly recruiting forensic scientists but it is unclear how swiftly they will fill the positions. At most, LGC Forensics has a quarter of the market, with Orchid Cellmark handling 5 to 10% of forensic tests.One issue police forces must contend with is extra administration, tracking and agreed deadlines for evidence that will be sent out to multiple companies.At the same time, police are looking to expand their own role in forensics, by handling more cases internally. The Metropolitan, West Yorkshire and West Midlands forces have developed plans to becoming both customer and supplier of forensic services.The Met is recruiting tens of scientists to replace and build on evidence recovery duties previously handled by the FSS.One long term hope, according to Gary Pugh, director of forensic services at the Met, is for officers to take fingerprints at a crime scene, send the image to a police lab over a mobile phone network, and have a suspect's name and picture sent to patrol cars within 20 minutes.A similar system for genetic fingerprint analyses might be turned around in an hour, he said.Police forces expect to make savings when forensic testing is brought in-house, but part of the financial advantage they have over private companies and the Forensic Science Service comes from few of their laboratories meeting recognised quality standards.That is in stark contrast to private forensics companies, which are required to meet these by complying with procedures outlined in ISO17025. Around 15% of the costs incurred by forensics companies go into maintaining accredited laboratories, making the cost of forensic work more expensive. Without accredited labs, police forces can run forensic tests more cheaply, if less reliably.The Forensic Science Regulator, appointed by the Home Office to uphold the quality of forensic science in the criminal justice system, has given police forces until 2015 to get their laboratories accredited, a deadline that could yet be pushed back further."How many cases will run through unaccredited laboratories between now and 2015? Doesn't that suggest a double standard?" the forensics specialist said.Police forces already spend more on in-house forensics than they do with private companies, and despite a fall in "all crime" between 2008-9 and 2009-10, total costs have risen by £19.5m to around £369m.The expansion of some police laboratories and recruitment drives at private forensics firms will not bolster capacity enough to handle any sudden surge of forensic work, as was dealt with by the Forensic Science Service in the aftermath of the bombings and attempted bombings in London in July 2005.Thousands of hours of forensic work by more than 100 FSS scientists led to the identification of the bombers within 24 hours and the conviction of those who attempted attacks.As the official "supplier of last resort", the FSS was obliged to meet the demand the terrorist attacks created. Private companies cannot be compelled in the same way.Many forces have moved their business away from the FSS in the past few years, with some forces setting up consortiums to buy in forensic services. Nineteen of the 43 forces in England and Wales, and the Serious Organised Crime Agency, are in the process of moving their work from the FSS to other companies.Only seven have completed the transfer, four have almost completed, and eight are still in the process of securing contracts.A source close to the transition board, which is handling the closure of the FSS, said police forces were "rising to the challenge" of transferring their work. So far, the cost of the closure has reached more than £85m.One of the key areas of FSS work is ballistics and a scientific source who asked not to be named said there were serious concerns about the vacuum left with the closure of the FSS.In fatal shootings, ballistics experts from the FSS always attend postmortems, and in cases where the police request them they are called to the murder scene to analyse the evidence."Being on the scene and in the postmortem provides key information about the bullet trajectory and the range the shot was fired from amongst other things," said a source."The FSS is the only forensic lab that sends ballistics experts to the postmortem and to the scene. No one seems to have thought about who will be doing this in future."Much of the ballistics work of the FSS will be taken over by the National Ballistics Intelligence Agency, which is based in the West Midlands, but it is not clear whether their work will involve investigations at the scene.The FSS also holds an armoury of firearms, which numbers in the many thousands, and which are used to test bullets from murder scenes to establish the make of the firearm in the crime.These thousands of guns, some dating back to the first world war are not matched by any belonging to NBIS. Sources close to the transition board confirmed that no decision has been made on what should happen to the armoury.
