Charles Clarke twice offered to resign over the Home Office's failure to consider more than 1,000 foreign offenders for deportation, it was revealed today.Downing Street confirmed Mr Clarke offered his resignation yesterday at 4pm, after the scandal emerged at lunchtime. Mr Clarke said in earlier interviews that he had offered to resign on an earlier occasion as well."The prime minister agreed with the home secretary that the best thing was for him to sort it out," Tony Blair's official spokesman said. Answering Tory demands for his resignation in the Commons today, Mr Clarke today said that he considered that it was his responsibility to "put things right".During a statement to the lower house following prime minister questions, Mr Clarke said the blunder over deporting foreign prisoners was "deeply regrettable".He was noisily barracked by opposition parties who loudly drew attention to the departure of Mr Blair and Gordon Brown after PMQs.The home secretary told MPs that of the 288 cases that should have been considered since August, 83 had been started, 53 had been completed and 14 deported. He confirmed that consideration of the most serious cases was underway and promised to update MPs on progress by the end of the week.However, this did nothing to appease shadow home secretary, David Davis, who said: "It is the first duty of government to protect the public as you yourself have reminded us in the last few days. I am afraid the events of the last few days have demonstrated that there has been a culpable failure to protect public safety."Following on from your statement on murders committed by offenders on probation last week, this is yet another example of your department's failure and incompetence. There is no excuse for you not knowing about this."Mr Davis said that the scale of the mess had accelerated after Mr Clarke was made aware of the situation last year.Earlier, Mr Blair acknowledged that the system for considering the deportation of released foreign prisoners had been "seriously and fundamentally at fault".Mr Blair told the Commons that he "regretted" the failure to keep tabs on more than 1,000 foreign offenders but insisted a proper management system was now in place.The Tory leader, David Cameron, said Mr Clarke had presided over "systemic failure," failed to deal with it and "misled people" over the scale of the problem."Isn't it clear that he cannot give the Home Office the leadership it so badly needs?" he demanded to Tory cheers, in highly charged exchanges.Mr Blair responded: "It won't surprise you to know I don't agree with that."Mr Cameron went on: "We now know even after ministers were told about the problem in July, 288 prisoners were released without being considered for deportation."Why did the home secretary last night describe that as 'very, very few people'?"Mr Blair responded that "over 70" of the 288 released between August last year and the end of last month had now had their cases considered, and "some of them have been deported".The prime minister said that an investment of Â£2.7m in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate meant that all foreign prisoners' cases were being considered for deportation before release for the first time "in decades".Earlier this morning, the home secretary revealed that he had tendered his resignation to Tony Blair but the prime minister turned his offer down, telling Mr Clarke "he didn't' think it was right".It was also revealed that the Inspectorate of Prisons had warned the Home Office three years ago that there was "institutional blind spot" regarding foreign nationals in British prisons and that Immigration Service had a "dilatory attitude" regarding their deportation.Revealing that he informed the prime minister before Christmas of the Home Office's blunder, Mr Clarke told the BBC he had offered to resign."I told him I was prepared to resign if he thought it was right. He said he didn't think it was right."An unhappy Downing Street yesterday accepted Mr Clarke's argument that the Home Office was now rectifying the mistake and that he was best placed to do it.In a written statement yesterday Mr Clarke admitted that a departmental bungle had resulted in the release of 1,023 overseas criminals since 1999 - among them murderers, rapists and paedophiles - without them being considered for deportation.Mr Clarke claimed the most dangerous of these were not simply walking the streets but would be under the normal supervision that serious offenders face when released from prison.He said his department was now working through the list, with the most dangerous as the priority, to see if these foreign criminals should be deported.The 2002/03 Inspectorate of Prisons report to the Home Office clearly flagged up the general problem agencies were having with foreign nationals in British prisons and the specific failure of the Immigration Service to monitor deportations.The report states, "This institutional blind spot for foreign nationals as a whole is evident from the fact that 32 prisons that we reported on had no specific foreign national work, and many did not know how many they held until inspectors informed them."This was not helped by the dilatory attitude of the Immigration Service, which, unless pressed, was not monitoring those liable to deportation, and making arrangements for this to take place as soon as sentence had expired. "The home secretary blamed a breakdown in communications between two large organisations - the Prison Service and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate - which he said were working under pressure.He told GMTV: "It's the fault of the Home Office as a whole and it's the fault of successive ministers and senior officials - there's no question of that. We haven't made that work as we should have done."Mr Clarke acknowledged that the National Audit Office warned the government about the issue last summer. "The truth is, it is like the old story of the tanker turning around. We have very large organisations and it takes time to get it right, and that's what we are doing."Asked if he believed he would still be in his job at the end of the day, he replied: "I certainly hope so.But immigration minister Tony McNulty and former home secretary David Blunkett both warned that "heads could roll" once the dust has settled. The former Tory leader and home secretary Michael Howard also called on Mr Clarke to resign, telling the BBC, "I'm afraid that if this government has an ounce of honour left, Charles Clarke has to go."Among the total of 1,023 foreign criminals were three murderers, nine rapists and five paedophiles. Another seven had served time for other sex offences, 57 for violent offences and two for manslaughter.There were also 41 burglars, 20 drug smugglers, 54 convicted of assault and 27 of indecent assault. A further 28 had been convicted of immigration offences, including people trafficking.The Home Office admitted that it did not know the full details of the offences committed by more than 100 of the prisoners, and Mr Clarke said he could not promise that all 1,023 would be traced.The department refused to name the criminals, even though it could aid its attempts to track them down.The admission of failure by the Home Office was only uncovered as a result of persistent questioning by Richard Bacon, a Tory MP on the public accounts committee.The Home Office later put out a brief statement denying a statement by Sir Menzies Campbell at prime minister's questions that a Nigerian prisoner had been seen walking out of a prison in Stockton, saying the offender in question "remains in detention at HMP Holme House".
