A mother jailed for life for murdering her 12-week-old son lost her appeal against her conviction today.Three court of appeal judges ruled that the conviction of Chaha'Oh-Niyol Kai-Whitewind at Birmingham crown court in December 2003, was safe.The judges, Lord Justice Judge, Mrs Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Leveson, last year freed Donna Anthony - who served nearly seven years in jail for killing her two children - after ruling her convictions were "unsafe".Although they dismissed Kai-Whitewind's appeal, Lord Justice Judge said: "The law relating to infanticide is unsatisfactory and outdated. The appeal in this sad case demonstrates the need for a thorough re-examination."The prosecution's case at trial was that 28-year-old Kai-Whitewind, from Maas Road, Northfield, Birmingham, killed baby Bidziil by asphyxiation after becoming frustrated with his refusal to breastfeed.Kai-Whitewind, who changed her name after adopting a native American culture, denied murder throughout her trial.Her lawyers relied on the court's judgment in the case of Angela Cannings - who was cleared on appeal of killing her two babies - in arguing during her appeal that her conviction was unsafe because it was based on an assessment by the jury of the evidence of experts who gave conflicting opinions as to whether natural causes of death could be excluded.They contended that "in cases such as this, where there is no independent evidence safe to put before a jury, an assessment by a jury based on the relative performance of disputing experts will make any conviction unreliable".They said that "having one set of experts pitted against the other in the absence of any independent evidence is not an appropriate way to get to a true verdict in a case where the state of scientific knowledge is still developing".In recent months, a series of women who spent years in prison have had their convictions quashed after doubts were raised about the reliability of expert medical evidence in infant death cases.But the crown, which contested Kai-Whitewind's appeal, did not accept it was a case of unexplained or sudden infant death syndrome or cot death. It submitted there was plain evidence, outside the medical evidence, which enabled the jury to convict.
