The Home Office's neighbourhood policing strategy appeared not to have cut crime in the first year it was rolled out nationally, a government review has found.But the report, published by the Home Office, said it was too soon to say whether this meant the policy was failing.It also said neighbourhood policing had had "a significant positive impact" when it was piloted in a small number of local areas.The neighbourhood policing report was posted by the Home Office on its website last Thursday, the same day Sir Ronnie Flanagan's review of policing was published. The neighbourhood policing report was not publicised with a press release.The government piloted neighbourhood policing, which involves targeted foot patrols and officers increasing their contact with residents, from 2003 to 2005. In April 2005 the programme was rolled out nationally, with the intention that every area would have a neighbourhood policing team by 2008.The Home Office study judged the pilots a success."When piloted at a local level, neighbourhood policing was found to have a significant positive impact on a wide range of outcome measures, including criminal victimisation, perceptions of antisocial behaviour and public confidence in the police," the report said."Follow-up research found that the vast majority of these improvements were sustained in the longer term."But, in the first year of the programme being rolled out nationally, the results were "less clearcut", the report went on."This is not uncommon when programmes are 'scaled up' and introduced in more challenging environments," the report said."Measurement and implementation issues meant that no improvements were found."At this stage, therefore, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of neighbourhood policing â€“ either positive or negative."The report said its findings did not mean that neighbourhood policing did not work. A firm conclusion would only be possible in the longer term.
