Thankfully, incidents of this nature are rare and this is an isolated incident.“There are a team of detectives working on this investigation and we have increased patrols in the local area. Although we are investigating that the attackers may have known the victim, as a precaution, I would encourage anyone in the local area to be extra vigilant.“Neighbourhood officers are patrolling the area of Redcar seafront and anyone who may have information is urged to speak to an officer, or to call Cleveland police on 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
