Householders should use "whatever force is necessary" to defend their homes and families from intruders, the country's most senior police officer said yesterday.In an interview following a series of brutal murders of homeowners in London, the outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, ruled out the use of guns or firearms. But he said: "My own view is that people should be allowed to use what force is necessary and that they should be allowed to do so without any risk of prosecution. There is a definite feeling in the general public that we need clarity in the law." He told the Daily Telegraph: "Of course you do not want to use excessive or gratuitous violence, and certainly not firearms. The presumption needs to be that the person using force to defend themselves is acting within the law, not the other way around." Sir John said that the case of Tony Martin, the farmer who shot dead a teenage burglar in 1999, had distorted the issue. Martin "did shoot the burglar as he was running away. He did use a gun that was illegal. The Martin case skewed everything, and it was the wrong case to concentrate on". Sir John said the public had a "real difficulty" understanding what force they could use in self-defence. The current legal test of "reasonable force" should be replaced. "This is an issue that needs to be concentrated on by parliament." Sir John's comments come days after John Monckton, a financier, was stabbed to death in an attempted robbery at his home in Chelsea. Sir John will step down in January, to be replaced by Sir Ian Blair, deputy commisioner, in January.
