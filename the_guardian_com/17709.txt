Naseem Hamed, the self-styled "prince" of the boxing ring, could never be described as shy.During his decade-long career, the Sheffield-born star became notorious for his flamboyant entrances and his unorthodox fighting style.Being carried into the ring on a throne and being deposited by an elevator were among his more creative entrances, which usually involved a flip over the ropes as a finishing touch.But it is his antics outside the boxing arena that have attracted the most attention in recent years.Despite frequent talk of a comeback, the 32-year-old has not fought for four years and has become better known, at least in his hometown, for posing in his collection of fast cars than for his skills in the boxing ring.Born of working class Yemeni parents in Sheffield in 1974, Hamed developed his distinctive style at Brendan Ingle's famous gym in Sheffield. From an early age he was considered a prodigy.By the age of 12 he was a top amateur boxer in England and Europe and at 18 he signed his first professional contract.He won his first professional title in 1995, knocking out Wales's defending WBO world featherweight champion Steve Robinson in eight rounds in front of Robinson's home crowd in Cardiff. He was awarded an MBE in 1999.He successfully defended the title throughout the 90s until losing it in April 2001 in Las Vegas against Marco Antonio Barrera.Known for his hand speed and knockout power, he lost only one of his 37 fights and won several world titles.He was initially managed by the boxing promoter Frank Warren until his brother took over towards the end of his career.A devoted Muslim, Naz, as he is often known, initially shunned the glamorous social life that came with his career, concentrating on his boxing and close family.But his soft spot for fast cars saw him running into trouble with the law long before the crash last May for which he was jailed today.When he was 21 he lost his licence for driving 20mph over the speed limit in Sheffield, and a year later he was banned from driving for 12 months after he was caught doing 110mph on the M1.Soon after getting his licence back he crashed a Ferrari that he had borrowed for a test drive, and in 1999 he was again fined for speeding.His car collection has been one of the main repositories of his Â£30m boxing earnings, and has included Porsches, Aston Martins, Bentleys and Range Rovers. He boasted of owning 14 cars "for my different moods" and employing two people to look after them.Late last year, Hamed talked about making a comeback this year, saying he had been offered a six-fight contract with an American television company.He said at the time: "I've really missed boxing because I've been doing it for a hell of a long time and I consider myself not bad at it. But then again, I think boxing has missed me and it's time to get back."
