A police officer is in a serious but stable condition after being slashed across the throat today in a London suburb.A police community support officer (PCSO) was also injured as they stopped a man in Ealing Broadway, west London, to check he had paid his bus fare.It is understood the man, who was later arrested, pulled out a knife after a routine check revealed that he was wanted for recall to prison.The officers were stabbed yards from Christ Church Primary school, where parents were collecting children at the end of the school day.Police officers routinely wear protective vests on duty, but the neck and head are exposed.The injured police officer, 23, was undergoing surgery tonight. The 27-year-old PCSO was treated in hospital and later released after suffering stab wounds to his head as he wrestled with the attacker.Chief Superintendent Andy Rowell, the Ealing borough police commander, said the incident occurred when a man began "behaving suspiciously" after being approached by the PCSO. On being challenged he allegedly turned his knife on the PCSO and the officer, who suffered multiple stab wounds which were initially thought to be life threatening.Eyewitness Inam Mir, assistant manager of the Sony Centre on New Broadway, said police had been checking the tickets of passengers disembarking from a bus at a stop near the store when suddenly "it kicked off".He said: "We heard screams and saw people running away. There were people running everywhere. We saw police officers who went to go and help running past with blood on their hands. Some were running past with medical kits."It's quite shocking. You don't expect to see that in broad daylight. There were police and ambulances. No one really knew what was going on."
