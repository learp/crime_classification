The big problem with stop and search, is that ethnic minority people are more likely to be stopped and interrogated by the police than white people.And since the vast majority of people stopped are wholly innocent, that leads to resentment and has in the past damaged the police's already shaky relationship with minority communities.Police are accused of using their powers in a racist and discriminatory way, a charge they are all the more exposed to because most of the big forces are whiter than the communities they serve. In short the accusation is that prejudices held by some officers are leading them to stop people who do not look like them, not a desire to prevent and detect crime.The concern over stop and search is decades old, and its corrosive effects when used in an overtly racist way were seen in the flames that engulfed Brixton, south London in April 1981.Riots broke out fuelled by several factors, including the hated "sus" laws which led to black and Asian people being stopped without reasonable suspicion.In the immediate run up to the riots police launched a huge stop and search drive in the area. Days later, the area went up in flames.Privately those those who are now in the upper echelons of Britain's police service say that bad stuff used to go on in the 1970s and 1980s, but that those days are behind the modern police service, and its ever present publicly-stated intention to be more community friendly.Fast forward nearly three decades from those "Life on Mars" days of policing, and the news today is of large levels of stops and searchs being carried out in urban areas, and without reasonable suspicion.The powers in the news today are those granted to the police to stop people without having reasonable suspicion, and have been branded the "new sus laws".The power allowing such stop and searches is contained under section 60 of the Crime, Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and was introduced by the Tory home secretary, Michael Howard, to tackle noisy ravers and football hooligans, who are mostly white. It is now being used far more widely than those original purposes.Under this power a senior officer decides that in a particular area there is danger of serious violence or disorder.Past research has shown the Afro-Caribbean people are up to 27 times more likely to be on the wrong end of a section 60 stop than white people.This is known officially - perhaps euphemistically â€“ as disproportionality. It is also evident in other stop and search powers the police have.Counter-terrorism stop and search powers have never actually led to the arrest of anyone who was later convicted of a terrorist offence. And again, Asian and Afro-Caribbean innocent people are far more likely to be stopped than white innocent people. So why do the police bother perservering with this power when communities affected say it damages their trust and confidence in the police. Officers say even if it does not lead to terrorists being caught, it does disrupt and deter them.Police also have powers to stop and search under the Police and Criminal Evidence act of 1984, but have to have reasonable grounds. Again figures over the years have shown that black people are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched.So it was with some nervousness that Scotland Yard bosses last May announced they would increase their use in section 60 stops, in area where they feared knife crime. It came as a response to rising concern among police and politicians about the deaths of young people caused by stabbings.Scotland Yard said the "in your face policing" risked stoking community tensions but believed that the "horrendous" catalogue of murders and stabbings of young people would lead people to back the tougher measures.Launching Blunt 2 last May police believed the frequency of killings and stabbings would sway people to support measures some saw as tough, and others as kneejerk.Police chiefs will point to the fall in deaths as a result of knife crime as proof their tactics have succeeded. They will also say that the communities who would have previously opposed them, now support the tough measures - in part because police are prepared to explain why they are using such tough or draconian powers, and because communities themselves want such action taken.With the new commissioner vowing to keep using the tactics, police and those who observe them know that it will only take a few incidents of police being shown to be abusing their powers for damage to be caused.
