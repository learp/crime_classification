Many offenders are escaping justice because of a "pragmatic" approach to sentencing, the independent crown prosecution service inspectorate says in a report today.The policy of dropping charges when a defendant has been convicted of other offences clashed with targets to reduce the "justice gap"- the difference between the number of recorded crimes and the number of crimes for which an offender is brought to justice. The inspectorate found that 50% of cases where charges were dropped on "public interest" grounds were discontinued because they would make no difference to the sentence. It meant many victims were not seeing "their" criminal brought to justice. It points out that the crown prosecution service has only a "modest effect" on the justice gap because just 14% of detected crimes are prosecuted.
