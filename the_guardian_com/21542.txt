Two men were arrested yesterday in connection with the murder of an elderly peace campaigner whose death nearly 20 years ago led to rumours that the security services and the nuclear industry were involved.West Mercia police confirmed the two men were being held in connection with the murder of Hilda Murrell, whose half-naked body was found on March 24 1984 in a coppice six miles from her home in Shrewsbury. She had been stabbed and left to die of hypothermia. Last June, Andrew Harold George, described as a builders' labourer from Shrewsbury, was charged with her murder and remanded in custody until a hearing next month. He would have been 16 at the time of Murrell's death. Detectives began a "cold case" review of the killing in 2002, saying they would re-examine 3,000 statements, 500 police reports, 6,000 lines of inquiry and more than 3,000 exhibits. Police arrested the men yesterday morning at undisclosed locations, and they are being held for questioning. Although police believed initially that Murrell, 78, was probably the victim of a bun gled burglary, her background as an anti-nuclear campaigner prompted conspiracy theories. At least two authors have claimed Murrell was killed by a team working for security services who bungled a search of her home. Murrell had been preparing to give evidence in the public inquiry into the proposed Sizewell B nuclear reactor. It later emerged that the pro-nuclear lobby had placed protesters under surveillance, although Murrell was not on a leaked list of "targets". The fact that her nephew was a naval intelligence officer during the Falklands war led to speculation about MI5 plots.
