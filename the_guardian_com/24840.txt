A flagship Home Office scheme to deport foreign criminals and save £10m a year has led to only two offenders leaving the UK, according to a watchdog report published by immigration inspectors.The report – which the home secretary, Theresa May, has sat on for more than five months – says a Home Office target of removing 62 immigration offenders under a conditional cautioning scheme has been wildly missed during the past 12 months.May has still not published four other reports she received in August from John Vine, the chief inspector of borders and immigration. They are believed to include two highly critical reports on nationality and overstayers.The flagship cautioning scheme was announced by the home secretary in April last year in an attempt to increase the number of deportations of foreign nationals charged with petty and low-level offences. Under the scheme individuals can avoid prosecution by agreeing to leave the UK for at least five years and accepting a caution.But the Vine report says that the Home Office consistently missed its targets for offering cautions to foreign nationals who had been arrested by the police as well securing their removal.The failure is uncovered in the inspection report on Operation Nexus, under which immigration officials work jointly with the police to boost the deportations of foreign criminals.The chief inspector says Operation Nexus had more success in increasing the number of removals in London where there has been a 158% rise in the number of immigration offenders from 418 in 2011/12 to 1,077 in 2013/14.But he found a similar effort in the West Midlands where immigration officials were “embedded” in three police custody suites was less effective.The chief inspector says that only 336 out of 717 foreign criminals who identified themselves to the police had their immigration status checked and the number of removals barely improved during the period of the special operation.Operation Nexus has since been extended to Manchester and Scotland but, as the Commons public accounts committee documented, there has been too little progress in increasing the number of foreign criminals leaving the country despite nearly £1bn being spent and a tenfold increase in staffing.Vine said the police and immigration officials were more successful in targeting “high harm” criminals for deportation leading to 85 of them leaving Britain in the past year. He said that such successful cooperation showed the potential for Operation Nexus to be implemented successfully.The immigration minister James Brokenshire said: “Since its inception, Operation Nexus has helped us remove over 3,200 foreign nationals including 194 dangerous immigration offenders considered by police to represent a particularly serious threat. We are pleased this report praises the positive impact Operation Nexus is having in London and the West Midlands, which have seen a rise of more than a third in the number of illegal immigrants identified through joint working with police since the inception of the operation in 2012. We are in the process of rolling Nexus out across the UK.”
