The government has welcomed a report calling for new role models to divert young black men from gangs and criminality, and said it will consider a national scheme to tackle the problem.The independent Reach report, a year-long study written by 20 experts and published today, calls on the government to tackle underachievement and low aspirations among black boys and young black men. The communities secretary, Hazel Blears, received the report on behalf of the government in Manchester today and promised a full government response later in the year. "We particularly welcome the report's emphasis on the contribution positive role models - like doctors, lawyers, and other professionals - can play in helping raise aspirations and inspire young black men."We will consider how the government might support this recommendation for a national role modelling programme, which emphasises those local people making a real contribution to civic life in their communities," Ms Blears said of the report, which claims that too many black male role models glamorise crime, guns or drugs.The Reach report suggests a five-point plan for how communities, local agencies, parents and the government can work together to improve the life chances of young black men and claims that tackling underachievement could boost the economy by Â£24bn in the next 50 years. Ms Blears said: "Much has been done to tackle race inequality - but there is more to do. The new Commission for Equality and Human Rights will commence its work in October and bring a stronger and renewed focus to tackling these issues."We are already making significant progress in tackling educational attainment gaps but recognise we need to go much further. "As a result of work in schools, the proportion of black Caribbean boys achieving five good GCSEs is up 11 percentage points since 2003, compared to the national increase of seven percentage points. "Schools are also already stepping up work to strengthen how they engage parents. We want to see this work extended and replicated across the country." Ms Blears said the government would work with community leaders to "remove barriers facing black boys and young black men".
