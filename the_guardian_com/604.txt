The home secretary, John Reid, is holding emergency talks with senior prison and probation service officials as the prison population approaches full capacity.As the number of prisoners incarcerated is expected to reach capacity of 80,000 within a week, an announcement is thought to be imminent from the Home Office on emergency measures to house excess prisoners.One option - known as Operation Safeguard - is to use police cells to house up to 500 inmates.More controversially, a Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that a plan to deport or transfer to immigration centres up to 10,000 foreign prisoners is being considered.Contrary to some reports, Mr Reid is not meeting the director general of the prison service, Phil Weatley, but senior figures from both the Prisoner Service and the National Offender Management Service.Latest figures show the number of prisoners in England and Wales has reached 79,642, with capacity put by the Prison Service as 79,968.The population, already running at record levels, rose by another 357 in the week to September 29. If that trend continues, jails could be full within days.A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said the prison population was something which was "closely monitored".She pointed to announcements in July to create thousands of new prison places by building new prisons as well as expanding on existing ones.Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, called on Mr Reid to "act decisively".She said: "Faced with a crisis largely caused by successive home secretaries talking tough but failing to come to grips with effective prison policy, John Reid must now act decisively to divert petty offenders into enforced community work, addicts into treatment and the mentally ill into healthcare."Everyone knows that an overcrowded jail can do little or nothing to prevent the next victim."The home secretary will travel to Luxembourg later today to take part in a meeting with other justice and interior ministers from the European Union.He has already made clear that he would like to see more foreign prisoners removed more quickly from the UK, possibly serving part or all of their sentences in their home countries.Further negotiations on this may feature on the agenda at the EU meeting, which continues tomorrow.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, blamed "incompetence right at the top" for the crisis."It is a huge embarrassment for John Reid, who despite all his tough talk, has sat on his hands for nearly six months while a serious problem became an emergency."Labour have thrown thousands of people into prison without either creating the necessary capacity or adopting the measures needed to stop them reoffending after they're released."As a result, prisons are acting as a revolving door, overflowing with thousands of repeat offenders."This not only creates a dysfunctional prison system, it also creates levels of repeat crime which needlessly jeopardise public safety."This crisis is the result of inexcusable incompetence right at the top of the Labour government."The Tories warned the government had let the situation "run into the buffers".The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "Even though the government has given lots of non-custodial sentences, even though it's used probation more, even though it's let people out more, we are running into the buffers."The way you get prison numbers down is by cutting the offending. Half of all our crime today is caused by convicts who reoffend. "One of the reasons for that is our prisons have been allowed to get so crowded that we don't do any rehabilitation, we can't get them off drugs, we can't retrain and so the reoffending rates go up."
