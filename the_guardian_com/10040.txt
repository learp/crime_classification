A surprise 8% fall in recorded crime in England and Wales has unexpectedly extended the longest sustained drop in the crime rate since the second world war.The latest quarterly crime figures published today covering the 12 months to June 2010 show an 8% fall in police recorded crime and a 4% drop in offences reported by the British Crime Survey.The continuing fall in the crime rate, which has dropped more than 45% since 1995, suggests that the predicted recession-fuelled crime wave has so far been avoided – probably matching the less than feared rises in unemployment.The Home Office published crime figures showing falls in nearly all offences on both measures – police recorded and British Crime Survey – with the largest drops recorded in criminal damage (down 17% to 768,000), car crime (down 16% to 479,000), domestic burglary (down 8% to 263,000) and robbery (down 7% to 74,000). Gun crime is also down 2% to 7,900 incidents.The only category in the police recorded crime figures to rise was sexual offences (up 8% to 55,217) but the police cautioned against interpreting this as an increase in actual attacks as opposed to improved recording methods.The total number of offences recorded by police in the year to June 2010 was 4.2m – the lowest level since 1989.Although repeated opinion polls show that two-thirds of people believe the national crime rate has risen in recent years, official figures show continuing declines in the levels of anxiety over crime.The overall proportion of people who say they live in an area with high levels of anti-social behaviour fell from 16% to 14% in the last year. Falls were also reported on six of the seven measures of anti-social behaviour, including vandalism, graffiti, public drunkenness and teenagers hanging around the streets. The exception was noisy neighbours, which is a serious problem for 11% of those surveyed.The proportion of people with a high level of worry about violent crime fell to 13% of people responding to the British Crime Survey.The Association of Chief Police Officers' head of crime and chief constable of Warwickshire, Keith Bristow, said the latest figures showed police were continuing to play their part in driving down crime."The police recorded crime rates show falls in all violence categories, robbery, burglary, theft, fraud, drugs, vehicle crime and criminal damage, however we are not complacent," he said."Nationally we have been working to improve all areas of sex offence investigation. We remain determined to tackle people who commit sexual offences and we are making real progress in this critical area, particularly around giving victims confidence to come forward and report these crimes and we need them do so."The home secretary, Theresa May, said: "Victims of crime know that while any reduction in crime is welcomed, statistics only present a partial picture. There are still too many offences which ruin lives, whether they are recorded or not, and that means more needs to be done to bring down crime."She went on: "It is unacceptable that each day on average more than 26,000 people fall victim to crime and the police report stubbornly high levels of violence – on average 1,000 people are injured each day. We want to ensure that police and their partner agencies continue to work together to focus on fighting crime, which is why we are slashing bureaucracy to ensure police officers are visible and available on the streets, and making police forces more accountable to their local communities."The shadow home secretary, Ed Balls, said: "These figures are a tribute to the work of our police and local services and show that Labour's policies to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour were working. I hope the home secretary will now finally admit that crime fell substantially under Labour, helped by a record number of police officers, and that the risk of being a victim of crime is at a 30-year low."Balls said he was concerned about whether the reduced level of crime could be sustained under the spending cuts. "By failing to protect funding for the police in the spending review, the home secretary is taking huge risks with the public's safety, crime and national security." he said. "The government's deep cuts of 20% to policing could mean up to 20,000 fewer police officers, according to the Police Federation. And I'm particularly worried that specialist policing units, such as those to tackle organised crime, domestic violence or child abuse which the government no longer considers to be part of the frontline, could be the first to be cut."
