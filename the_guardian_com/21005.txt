Thieves broke into Hazel Blears' official car outside her constituency office in Salford yesterday, two weeks after a computer hard drive containing classified material was stolen from the same location.They took the driver's private mobile phone and a satellite navigation system, a spokesman for the communities secretary said. There was no ministerial paperwork in the car. A window of the Toyota Prius was smashed between 11am and 11.45am, and the items taken suggested it was an opportunistic break-in, police believe.Greater Manchester police said the phone was a personal one and contained no sensitive information.A fortnight ago burglars smashed reinforced glass to get into the minister's office at the Working Class Movement Library on a Saturday afternoon. It later emerged that the information on the stolen computer had been sent to her in breach of data protection rules. The department admitted officials had "not fully" complied with guidance on handling sensitive data.
