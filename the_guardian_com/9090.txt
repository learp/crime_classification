Mobile phone detonators attached to two car bombs left near a nightclub in the West End of London were called 15 times but the devices failed to explode, a court was told today.The visual displays of the two pay-as-you-go Nokia mobile phones left in each car revealed several missed calls, Woolwich crown court, in south-east London, heard.Police said the ringing circuit in each phone was wired to a lightbulb held in a syringe and surrounded by match heads.The devices were intended to ignite the petrol, gas cylinder and nail devices, but a lack of oxygen prevented them from going off.Detectives revealed the results of a four-day forensic examination of two Mercedes Benz saloons during the trial of two NHS doctors accused of plotting to detonate the car bombs.The green Mercedes was taken to the Forensic Explosives Laboratory at Fort Halstead, Kent; the second car, a blue Mercedes, was examined on a ramp outside the Westminster council car pound in Park Lane. It was clamped and towed away after a traffic warden found it parked at a bus stop in the early hours of June 29 last year. Bomb disposal experts used a robot to smash one of the car's windows to see what was inside. Jurors were shown detailed pictures of the two similarly improvised bombs found in the cars for the first time.The photographs revealed that both cars had patio gas cylinders planted in each rear passenger footwell with the mobile phone detonators placed between them.Around 900 nails were discovered in bags held in mesh on the backs of the front seats, and scattered about inside the cars. Barrels of petrol were packed into the boot in four 25-litre containers.The equipment was hidden by with two duvets and other items including umbrellas, a lampshade and hi-fi gear, the jury was told.The cars were left outside the Tiger Tiger nightclub, on Haymarket, and in adjoining Cockspur Street on June 29 last year.One of the accused, 29-year-old Bilal Abdulla, was caught on CCTV as he parked the green Mercedes outside the busy nightclub and ran off, the court heard.His DNA was found on a bloodstain on the dashboard, the cap of a petrol container and a gas cylinder, prosecutors said.Also in the car were a Coca-Cola bottle and a Bounty chocolate bar wrapper carrying Abdulla's DNA. A short brown hair attached to one of the mobile phones was identified as belonging to Kafeel Ahmed, 28, who drove the second blue Mercedes and later died from fatal injuries sustained in an attack on Glasgow airport the next day. In the second car bomb, disposal experts found Abdulla's DNA on tape used to hold electrical wiring together; Ahmed's DNA was found on a fast-food wrapper.Abdulla is on trial with Mohammed Asha, 28, accused of conspiracy to murder and to cause explosions.The men, who worked as doctors at NHS hospitals in Glasgow and Staffordshire, deny the offences.
