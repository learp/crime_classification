The deadliest affliction known to British politics, the Curse of Letwin, struck again yesterday, inadvertently demolishing Michael Howard's claim that crime is out of control in Brixton because there are no police to be found on its streets at night.Twenty-four hours after the Conservative leader used a Guardian article to attack the police record in the south London area - and columnist Polly Toynbee - for challenging his party conference thesis, internet researchers unearthed laudatory praise of the "Brixton miracle." It came from the lips of Oliver Letwin. But he could not be accused of stabbing Mr Howard in the back. He stabbed him in the front - in two public speeches. Admittedly, the shadow chancellor was shadow home secretary at the time and the past year in Tory politics has been a very long one. But at last year's Conservative conference in Blackpool Mr Letwin said he had visited Brixton, but found it to be an outstanding example of neighbourhood policing. "I saw Inspector Sean Wilson and his team reclaiming the streets for local people. Burglary is down, robbery is down, graffiti is wiped away, abandoned cars towed away. Central Brixton is a safer, happier place than it was a couple of years ago," he reported, having made similar claims in a speech in June. To compound future embarrassment to his party leader, Mr Letwin went on to say that it was "bobbies on the beat" - the ones Mr Howard told this year's conference he hadn't seen - that had made the difference in Brixton. When the Guardian pointed out to Mr Howard that his claims had infuriated the borough police commander and local residents because crime had fallen, not risen, the Tory leader retaliated. "They've howled in protest at my comments and demanded an apology. But no-one has contradicted what I said. I spoke the truth," he wrote in yesterday's paper.
