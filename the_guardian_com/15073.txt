More than 100 horses, ponies and donkeys were left to starve among the rotting carcasses of other animals at a family farm, a court heard today.Hooves and body parts of horses that had been "left to die" were scattered around and a mound of bones and skulls was discovered, it is claimed.The "horror scene" was uncovered after RSPCA inspectors were called to Spindle Farm at Hyde Heath in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, which housed the Gray family's horse-trading business.Bicester magistrates court heard many of the farm's 140 animals were left with little food or dry bedding and were crammed into pens ankle deep in faeces.Prosecutors said vets described the farm as the worst case of animal cruelty they had ever seen.In total 115 animals, some severely emaciated, had to be rescued and removed from the farm during a huge operation in January this year. James Gray, 45, Julie Gray, 41, Jodie Gray, 26, Cordelia Gray, 20, and a teenage boy who cannot be named face a total of 12 charges under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act.They relate to causing unnecessary suffering to and failing to meet the welfare needs of horses, ponies and donkeys.The trial continues.
