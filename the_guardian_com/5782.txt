Electrical goods company Dixons Retail has joined Crimestoppers in the launch of a Â£50,000 reward fund for information to help catch people involved in rioting and looting. The chain, which owns Currys, PC World and Dixons.co.uk, is hoping the fund will lead to the arrest and conviction of those who stole or damaged its property. Information can be provided to police or Crimestoppers anonymously. The company said it was "mostly back to business as normal". Anyone with any information that could lead to the arrest of offenders is asked to contact the police or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
