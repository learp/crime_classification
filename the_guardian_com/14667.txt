Nick Clegg has rejected claims that the government failed to provide leadership as the capital was hit by rioting over the weekend because senior ministers were away from London.As it emerged that Theresa May, the home secretary, is flying back to the UK for talks with police chiefs about the disturbances, Clegg defended the government's response to the trouble and condemned what he described as "needless opportunistic theft and violence – nothing more, nothing less".On his first day back in Westminster after his summer holiday Clegg said the violence was "completely unacceptable". The government stood "side by side with those people in those communities who utterly condemn the violence and the theft", he said.There have been complaints that the government did not have a senior minister in London at the weekend when the rioting broke out. But Clegg insisted that senior members of the cabinet had been in regular contact by phone."I reject completely this notion that somehow this government hasn't been functioning very effectively," said Clegg, who said he had spoken to David Cameron, who is on holiday in Italy, by phone on Monday morning."We have arranged things to make sure that this government works effectively on all the issues of the day. We are in constant contact with each other and we are working as effectively this week as we do in every other week of the year."According to Home Office sources May will be in the office on Monday afternoon for briefings on the disturbances, which saw more than 100 people arrested on Sunday night after the rioting that started in Tottenham on Saturday spread to other areas of the capital.The news came as the Metropolitan police said they would be putting more officers on the streets to restore order.Although the home secretary issued statements about the rioting over the weekend and discussed the situation with the police and the prime minister, the Home Office refused to comment on her whereabouts.On Monday officials would not say whether her return was scheduled or whether she was cutting short a holiday to deal with the crisis.Steve Kavanagh, a deputy assistant commissioner, said there were three times as many officers on duty on Sunday night as there had been when rioting broke out in Tottenham on Saturday, and promised that even more would be deployed on Monday.In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, when asked whether the police would be able to prevent a third night of disorder, he said: "I can be very assured that there will be even more officers out there, even more committed and braver than they have been so far, to make sure London stays as safe as possible."Asked if he could guarantee that rioting would not happen on Monday night, he replied: "I can give the commitment of the Metropolitan police to make sure we keep London as safe as possible."The police were already facing criticism for allowing rioting to break out in Tottenham after what started as a peaceful protest over the death of Mark Duggan at the hands of police armed response officers, and Sunday night's events will intensify claims that the police response has been inadequate.Kavanagh denied this, saying: "We were not flat-footed on either occasion." He said there had been no warnings that rioting was going to break out in Tottenham and the escalation of violence was unexpected."The levels of violence and the levels of organisation shown in the early hours of Sunday morning and last night were totally unexpected, the intensity of them," he said."The Metropolitan police did not let people take over the streets of London. We experienced a very rapid increase in the level of violence."We have got to recognise that social media and other methods have been used to organise these levels of greed and criminality, and we need to adapt and learn from what we are experiencing."Kavanagh defended Chief Superintendent Sandra Looby, the Tottenham police chief who has been criticised in the media for reportedly flying to Florida on Saturday, just before the rioting broke out.Kavanagh said there were no warnings that a riot would break out, that Looby had handed control to a senior officer and that she was returning to the UK because she was "very committed to that borough".In a statement issued on Monday morning – before it emerged that she would be returning to the UK to take charge – May said: "Last night police officers again put themselves in harm's way to protect Londoners and their property."Those responsible for the violence and looting will be made to face the consequences of their actions. Many have been arrested and further arrests will be made."Londoners have made clear that there are no excuses for violence, and I call on all members of local communities to work constructively with the police to help them bring these criminals to justice."Kit Malthouse, a deputy mayor of London who is responsible for policing, said "feral youth" and people intent on violence were to blame for the violence."There are people in this city, sadly, who are intent on violence, who are looking for the opportunity to steal and set fire to buildings and create a sense of mayhem, whether they are anarchists or part of organised gangs, or just, you know, feral youth who fancy a new pair of trainers," he said in an interview on BBC News.Malthouse urged the media not to offer excuses for the behaviour of the rioters. "I think we have to be careful, particularly in the media, not to create some kind of atmosphere of excuse for this kind of behaviour," he said."There was no excuse for the behaviour of the last two nights – we have to make that clear and bring those who perpetrated it to justice."In a separate interview Malthouse denied that the resignations last month of the Met commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, and Assistant Commissioner John Yates in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal had left the force with a leadership vacuum. Tim Godwin, the acting commissioner, was in charge, he said.He dismissed claims that too few officers had been deployed. "We can't just maintain a standing army sitting in vans all over the place just in case something might kick off," he said. "We have to employ those officers as efficiently as possible."
