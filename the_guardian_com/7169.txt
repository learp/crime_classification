A verdict in the inquest into the death of Mark Duggan is expected to be delivered at 3.30pm at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London.The Metropolitan police shooting in north London on 4 August 2011 triggered the worst riots in modern English history.The inquest, which began in September, was told by police that Duggan was shot twice after he produced a gun when surrounded by armed officers.Two shots were fired rapidly by the marksman. The first shot struck Duggan in one of his biceps. The second, entering through the chest and exiting his back, killed the father of four.The jury was told police believed Duggan was a member of TMD, Tottenham Man Dem, which officers believed had links to guns used in nightclubs.The officer who shot Duggan twice, known as V53, testified he had seen a gun in Duggan's right hand, and believed the suspect was preparing to use it. V53 said he had acted in self-defence, fearing that his own life or the lives of his colleagues were in danger from Duggan.The key issue for the jury was whether Duggan was holding a gun, as the marksman said, when he exited the cab and came face to face with armed police.There are three verdicts open to jurors. Only one of them, a verdict of unlawful killing, relies on the jurors being certain Duggan was not holding a gun, and being certain V53 did not have an honest belief the suspect was brandishing a weapon.The other two possible verdicts require a lower standard of proof, namely on the balance of probabilities.
