An investigation was launched today after a pensioner was shot dead by police marksmen.Armed response vehicles and police dog handlers were called to the village of Fernhurst, in West Sussex, shortly before lunchtime.Neighbours said officers surrounded a block of retirement flats where a man, who was thought to be in his 60s, was reported to be holding his wife at gunpoint.One witness said officers used a loudhailer to encourage the man to leave the flat before the fatal shot was fired.Another witness said she heard a policewoman shout: "We have stunned him, get an ambulance," during the confrontation.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched an inquiry and said its officials were at the scene.An IPCC spokeswoman said: "At approximately 3pm Sussex police referred the incident to the IPCC. IPCC investigators have been deployed to the scene to start the inquiry."A woman who lives in a retirement flat in the village said the incident took place in her block. She said police had told residents to stay in their homes."The police are still here," she said. "They have been here since midday. They won't let us out."Resident Sheila Moss said she had met the man who lived in the flat with an "invalid wife". Another resident said a man in his 60s was seen waving a gun in front of other pensioners at a warden-controlled property in the village.The shooting comes just months after Sussex police agreed to pay damages to the family of a man they shot dead in Hastings in 1998.James Ashley, 39, was naked and in bed when officers burst in at 4am. He was shot in front of his girlfriend after incorrect intelligence said he might be armed.Lawyers for his family said police admitted he was killed as a result of police negligence. PC Chris Sherwood was acquitted of murder and manslaughter.
