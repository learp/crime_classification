A British businessman suspected of beating his girlfriend to death in a Paris hotel was today urged to contact police.An international hunt has been under way for Ian Griffin since his wealthy girlfriend, Kinga Legg, was found dead at the Hotel Le Bristol in the French capital.Griffin allegedly fled the Â£1,000-a-night hotel in his Porsche 911, which was later recovered at an address in Warrington, where he grew up.Cheshire police said today: "If Ian Griffin is in the north-west, we would urge him to make contact with police, either in Cheshire or elsewhere in the region."The 39-year-old tycoon, who once worked as a male model, left the Hotel Le Bristol, on the Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore, on Tuesday.Hours later, Legg's body was found by a maid "battered and bruised" in the bathroom of the couple's suite.It emerged on Friday that officers in Cheshire and Surrey, where the couple rented a home, were searching locations connected to the couple.The Polish-born millionairess, 36, died from internal bleeding as a result of her injuries, French police said.Witnesses said they saw Griffin on Wednesday at Shepperton Marina in Surrey, where the couple keep a speedboat.Marina administrator Billy Leisengang said: "It was between midday and 2pm when one of my colleagues said, look there's Ian. I looked up and he was getting into a taxi which then drove away."Later, when I heard about what happened in Paris, it was a great shock. I had met Ian a few times and Kinga once. They were very decent people, the sort of people we like to have here at the marina."Griffin built a string of businesses, including tanning salons and gadget shops, across north-west England. But he was declared bankrupt in 2006.Legg ran her family company, Vegex, which supplies tomatoes to British supermarkets and has a base in Surrey and in her home town in Poland, Opatowek.The couple are understood to have been in a relationship for three years. They initially shared a home in Knutsford, Cheshire, which has also been searched by police but lately they lived in Oxshott, Surrey.Cheshire police said: "This investigation is being led by the French authorities and UK forces cannot comment on these matters. However, a number of forces, including Cheshire, are undertaking specific actions to support the French investigation. In Cheshire this has resulted in the recovery of a black Porsche car associated with Ian Griffin. Cheshire police has also interviewed a number of people associated with him."
