Moves by the home secretary, John Reid, towards allowing parents access to information on the whereabouts of paedophiles were condemned by chief constables last night.The Association of Chief Police Officers delivered damning criticism of the government after Mr Reid said he was prepared to consider importing "Megan's law", the US legislation under which the whereabouts of paedophiles released from prison are made known to parents. The News of the World has been campaigning for the introduction of a "Sarah's law," named after Sarah Payne, eight, who was abducted and murdered in 2000.Mr Reid announced at the weekend that he is sending a junior minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, to the US to investigate how the law has been implemented since it was introduced in 1997.Terry Grange, chief constable of Dyfed and Powys police and Acpo spokesman on violent crime, told Radio 4's The World Tonight: "The last three years has been a litany of abandonment of any real strategic design in the Home Office in the management of sex offenders, in favour of trying to find out what one particular tabloid newspaper wants and then complying with their wishes."The Liberal Democrats uncovered comments made by children's minister Beverley Hughes in 2001, when she was a junior minister in the Home Office, in then rejecting Megan's law.She said it was "unworkable" because "it drives offenders to ground".A No 10 spokesman said yesterday there was now a "body of experience" in the US to consider, but he acknowledged there were difficulties in bringing a version of Megan's law to the UK. "The important thing and the difficult thing in this is to get the balance right between, on the one hand, in protecting the public and giving the public as much information as possible, and on the other, making sure that you don't have vigilantes ... we are not planning immediately to import US laws but we do need to consider how these operate." The prime minister's spokesman added that the government accepted that "the public should have more information than they have done" about the whereabouts of paedophiles.
