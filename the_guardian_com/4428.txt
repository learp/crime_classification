Hundreds of police officers have been convicted of crimes including sex offences, violent assaults, drug use and possession of indecent images of children over the past three years.According to the figures obtained by the Press Association, 309 officers and police community support officers (PCSOs) were convicted of offences between 2012 and June of this year. However, only 25 out of 45 forces provided figures when approached, making it likely that the true figure is much higher.The most senior figure to be convicted since 2012 was former West Yorkshire police detective chief superintendent David Knopwood, who was sacked for gross misconduct last year after admitting driving while twice over the legal limit.In the Metropolitan police, 178 officers were convicted of crimes from 2012 to March 2015, with 54 of those still serving, 10 of whom were waiting for misconduct verdicts when the figures were compiled. In Greater Manchester, 12 police officers and five PCSOs had been convicted of crimes since 2012, with one seargeant convicted of misconduct in a public office, an inspector convicted of fraud and one PC convicted of possession of a class B drug.Devon & Cornwall police and Durham police revealed that they each had an officer who had been convicted of possessing indecent images of children.Devon & Cornwall also revealed two of their members were convicted of indecent exposure, and in Hampshire one of their officers was convicted of urinating in public in 2012.Insisting that the government was committed to police reform, a Home Office spokesman said: “The government will finish the job of police reform and introduce legislation later this year. It will overhaul the police complaints and disciplinary systems, strengthen protections for police whistleblowers and change the role, powers and governance of the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the remit of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary.”Warning that the findings could damage trust in the police, Lucy Hastings, director of the charity Victim Support, said: “Victims of crime will clearly find these figures alarming. It is critical that victims know they can trust the police so that they have confidence to report crimes.”At least 295 police officers with current convictions are still serving with the police, according to separate data provided to Press Association’s investigation by 18 forces across the country.
