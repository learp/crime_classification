A man wept after being cleared of murdering a teenager in the middle of Britain's busiest shopping street during the Boxing Day sales.Seydou Diarrassouba, 18, was stabbed through the heart with such force the knife snapped at the hilt, the Old Bailey heard. He then staggered out of the Foot Locker store and collapsed on the pavement in front of shoppers in Oxford Street, central London, and died.Jermaine Joseph, 23, of Tottenham, north London, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter by a jury. He said he had inflicted the fatal injuries in self-defence after he was chased into the sports shop.Diarrassouba, a student known as Nutz, and Joseph had been involved in a gang feud. Joseph told the trial Diarrassouba came at him with a knife. "He chased me. I stabbed him to stop him stabbing me. It's like a dog chasing the cat â€“ the cat still shows his claws," he said.Mark Heywood QC, prosecuting, said: "This case concerns gang violence in the street." It involved "bad blood" between Diarrassouba and his associates and Joseph and his friends.He added: "The grievance was evidently a deep and powerful one. It led almost instantly to ugly, brutish violence in broad daylight in a packed street on the busiest shopping day of the year. You may think that was one of the days and places people could go in peace."Thulani Khumalo, 20, from Finsbury Park, was discharged on the directions of the judge.
