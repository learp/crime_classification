David Cameron will today attempt to rebrand the Conservatives as tough on the causes of crime, as he calls for politicians to show more understanding towards teenagers in hooded tops.He will overturn years of Tory rhetoric on law and order by urging Britons to "show a lot more love" to young people - albeit "not a soppy love".John Major set the tone for the Conservatives several years ago when he argued that people should "condemn a little more and understand a little less". But today his successor will say: "We'll never get the answers right unless we understand what's gone wrong ... It doesn't mean excusing crime but it will help us tackle it."Mr Cameron will attack the prime minister for backing a shopping centre's ban on hooded tops, arguing: "We - the people in suits - often see hoodies as aggressive. But hoodies are more defensive than offensive ... In a dangerous environment the best thing to do is keep your head down, blend in, don't stand out."In a speech to voluntary workers at the Centre for Social Justice, founded by his predecessor, Iain Duncan-Smith, he will describe youth crime and disorder as a worsening problem that is wrecking many communities' sense of wellbeing.But he will add: "Too often, the debate is about short-term solutions: Asbos, curfews and criminal justice. Of course we need these things to protect the public from antisocial behaviour today. But my aim is a society where we need them less and less."When people behave well, he will argue,"we have to show a lot more love".Several rightwingers argued that Mr Cameron's message to "hug a hoodie" redressed an imbalance in the party's rhetoric. But others fear it will merely alienate core supporters, citing the party's recent near-defeat in its former stronghold of Bromley and Chislehurst."Traditional Tory voters may well raise their eyebrows. I think most people feel Britain has spent the last 30 or 40 years trying to understand and care and share - some of us are more persuaded by the powers of punishment," said one MP.The party is already suffering from divides over Mr Cameron's promise to withdraw from the main centre-right grouping in the European parliament, according to embarrassing leaked emails sent by one of the leader's aides and published by the Sunday Times.Desmond Swayne, Mr Cameron's parliamentary private secretary, warned that MEPs were "furious" about the promise, while Eurosceptics were concerned that "there is a very significant danger of the project being blown off course".He pointed to another potential division, saying that some backbenchers were expressing concern that "some of the front bench give the appearance of being stridently anti-nuclear".A Tory spokeswoman declined to comment on the emails.
