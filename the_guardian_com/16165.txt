The government is being taken to the high court over its plans to merge police forces, while rebel Labour MPs plan to derail the scheme in the Commons.Cleveland police force is to seek a judicial review of the home secretary's plans to merge it with the Durham and Northumbria forces.Meanwhile, a group of Labour MPs led by John Grogan intends to sabotage the merger plans when they come through the Commons in the autumn.This twin opposition is John Reid's second major headache since being appointed at the start of the month, following the debacle of the failure to deport released foreign prisoners.Mr Reid has already made it clear that he regards merging police forces to be on the backburner at the moment.The idea of bigger, better resourced, forces came in the wake of criticism of the small Cambridgeshire police force's response to the Soham murders.The proposal to cut the number of forces from 43 to 24, or even 17, was the brainchild of Mr Reid's predecessor, Charles Clarke.However, many of those forces pencilled in for amalgamation have raised objections.Today Dave Mcluckie, chairman of the Cleveland police authority, said he had tried to meet Mr Reid to discuss the plans, but this had proved impossible."We've tried very, very hard to meet with John Reid and his team since the day of his inception and we haven't been able to do that."We want to actually find resolution to this that didn't include court action. That hasn't been the case," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Mr Grogan, the MP for Selby, believes he has found a technicality on which mergers can be defeated.When the home secretary puts a statutory instrument before the Commons to authorise individual mergers, rebel MPs, with the aid of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, could demand a vote from the Speaker and potentially defeat the orders.Mr Grogan has been joined by home affairs select committee member Ann Cryer in opposing the mergers.Ms Cryer, whose west Yorkshire constituency is policed by one of the four forces in Yorkshire and the Humber due to be merged into one later this year, described the government's proposal as a "real mish-mash", and said: "Count me in. If there is a way around it, I will certainly be voting against it."Victory for the rebels would leave the government's merger plans looking decidedly lop-sided, with some forces agreeing to amalgamation and others preferring to retain their stand-alone status.Next April, strategic forces will be established covering Cumbria and Lancashire, the west midlands, Wales, Cheshire and Merseyside and the north-east. Even if the government wins its battle with the rebels, the earliest the Yorkshire and the Humber region could expect to set up its new force is one year later.Despite the early warning shots by Labour members of the home affairs committee, the committee chairman, John Denham, was yesterday adamant that the police service requires reform.Mr Denham, a former Home Office minister, refused to endorse or denounce the government's proposals, preferring to wait until the home secretary fleshes out last week's speech to the Association of Chief Police Officers when he stated that reform would move at a "slightly different pace"."There is a lot of knee-jerk reaction from opponents of reform. The case for reform is a powerful one if we are going to fight serious and organised crime. Backers of local policing need to be sure that it provides effective crime fighting," Mr Denham said.Today the Home Office said it was "premature" to seek a judicial review against the mergers, as the home secretary would not be making any decision on the plans until he had considered all views.Earlier this month Mr Reid suggested he was not sure about the merger proposals and may put them on hold for 12 months.But a Home Office spokeswoman said it was clear the present strategic structure of the police services was not fit for the purpose and that "the status quo is not an option"."The home secretary is working closely with police forces and authorities on police force restructuring and has made it clear that he will not make a final decision on whether to proceed with any mergers until he has carefully considered all views."It is therefore premature for anyone to be considering taking the home secretary to judicial review."The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "This is yet another nail in the coffin of the government's ill-thought-out proposals for regionalising our police forces."The upcoming legal challenges demonstrate the force of feeling among police authorities and the public against these rushed and damaging mergers. "It's time for John Reid to think again and drop these unpopular plans."
