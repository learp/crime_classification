The Serious Fraud Office has shifted the focus of its investigation into the Bernie Madoff investment scandal from the UK arm of his empire to some of the feeder funds that channelled investments to the multibillion-pound fraudster.The anti-white-collar crime unit today said it had dropped a 12-month inquiry into the UK arm of the convicted US conman's operations, Madoff Securities International (MSI), admitting it had found insufficient evidence for a prosecution.Investigators had in the past described MSI as "an important cog in the washing machine" – a reference to Madoff's efforts to move cash around the world to help give the impression that profits were being generated.The SFO insisted a probe was continuing into "wider aspects of the fraud which may give rise to offending in the UK". This is believed to be a reference to considerable feeder fund activity in London.SFO director Richard Alderman's decision to launch an independent UK investigation into the Madoff scandal surprised many fraud experts as the case was already being pursued by prosecutors in the US, the primary jurisdiction in which the fraud had taken place.At the time Alderman said: "This is a good example of the SFO's new, faster, approach to tackling fraud. The public say they want us to take early action and this is what we are doing."The SFO will now focus on the feeder funds, which had placed the vast majority of the $50bn (£31bn) under management at Madoff's bogus investment operation.After ­Madoff's arrest in December, most of these funds told angry ­investors around the world that they too were unwitting ­victims, with many fund managers ­personally investing with Madoff. However, they remain under intense ­regulatory scrutiny and some have already been the target of class-action lawsuits in the US.Last March the Guardian revealed that SFO investigations into the London branches of feeder funds led investigators to believe certain feeder operations may have played a more actively dishonest role in the fraud, beyond simply failing to make sufficient checks that client money entrusted to Madoff was being properly invested.SFO investigators have spent months trying to work out which funds to treat as victims and which might be fraud suspects. The prosecuting agency had said it expected to bring charges by the end of last year but has yet to do so.
