Blank British passports stolen from a security van would be worth £2.5m on the black market, police said today.The Foreign Office admitted a serious breach of security when a van carrying the new passports destined for British embassies overseas was hijacked a short distance from the factory that made them.A spokeswoman said 24 parcels containing passports and vignettes - the blank stickers for visa stamps – had been stolen from a van en route from the factory in Oldham to RAF Northolt near London.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, demanded an urgent inquiry into the incident, while security experts warned the passport chip security was vulnerable to a cloning attack.The van was stolen when the driver stopped to buy a newspaper, police said. An offender attacked a second delivery man in the van, before driving a short distance away, parking the van and making off with the passports.Police described the vehicle used simply as a white Transit van.Security arrangements for the movement of passports are normally overseen by the Home Office through a sub-contracted security firm.The department said drivers were not allowed unauthorised stops and sensitive documents were transported in armoured or secure vehicles.However, because these passports were going to embassies, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) was responsible for delivery."The security vans we use have an array of security features. Although we have never used armoured vehicles, which are much less flexible and more expensive than the security vans we currently use, we have used non-armoured security vans for 15 years without incident," the FCO said in a statement.Around 3,000 documents were said to be missing, but the spokeswoman could not confirm the number."I find it extraordinary that the theft of so many passports was even possible" Vaz said."This Government has put the eradication of illegal immigration at the top of the political agenda."It is therefore completely unacceptable that such sensitive documents are transported in a way that puts them at risk of theft."Official claims that the passport security features made them "unusable" were challenged by analysts who said the chips in the new documents were easy to clone.Equipped with a genuine British passport, forgers would simply have to replace the blank chip with a cloned one containing the details of whoever they wanted, said independent consultant Adam Laurie, founder of RFIDIOt.org, an open source library that covers security tag readers."One of the problems with the passports is that there are no security features to stop their cloning," said Laurie. "If you've got a genuine passport, dropping in a replacement chip is trivial."He advised taking the official claims on their usability "with a massive pinch of salt".A former Scotland Yard fraud officer, Tom Craig, told the BBC's Today programme the stolen passports would be worth about £1,700 each, whether the chip security was compromised or not."That is because they can be used by putting in biographical information of your own, not necessarily getting the chip information right, and then you can use them to open up bank accounts or actually get employment," Craig said."These passports can be used anywhere in the world. If they come to the UK they are more likely to be picked up because the serial numbers will be recorded."A Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed the documents had been produced at an Oldham-based printing firm, 3M Security Printing and Systems.The raiders struck at 6.40am yesterday in Long Lane, Chadderton, - half-a-mile from the firm's printing works in Gorse Street, Greater Manchester police said.The raid took place as the driver stopped off to buy a newspaper at Yogis newsagents. Greater Manchester police confirmed the offender threatened the delivery man waiting in the van and forced him to lower his head before assaulting him."The offender then drove the van - with the victim still inside - a short distance to an unmarked road. The robber then got out and escaped," a spokeswoman added."As soon as he felt safe to do so, the man in the passenger seat got out to see what had happened and discovered a number of boxes had been stolen."Yogesh Patel, 25, the owner of Yogis, served the driver yesterday morning."He walked in and got a few things. He came in and bought chocolate and a newspaper - I think it was a Mail or a Mirror."He just bought the paper and came back an hour later with a police officer." Patel said."The actual value of the passports themselves is around £2.5m," said Detective Chief Inspector Bill McGreavy.3M Security Printing and Systems, one of the biggest security printers in the UK and at the heart of government plans to introduce biometric passports, was previously owned by German company Authentos.
