A man has been jailed for assaulting his girlfriend who was blinded in a brutal attack by a previous partner.In April 2011 Tina Nash, 33, was throttled unconscious by her then boyfriend Shane Jenkin at her home in Cornwall. He then gouged her eyes out.Jenkin was jailed for life and told he would not be considered for parole until he had served six years after admitting grievous bodily harm with intent against the mother of two.Nash became a campaigner for victims of domestic violence and wrote a book called Out of the Darkness partly to try to persuade others not to suffer in silence.It emerged on Monday that her new partner, Roland Alli, 32, has been jailed for attacking Nash at her home in Penzance.Alli had been due to stand trial for common assault but changed his plea at Truro magistrates court in Cornwall and was jailed for 14 weeks.The court heard Alli from Plymouth, Devon, subjected an "extremely vulnerable" Nash to a sustained attack in her home on 16 June.Alli was handed a restraining order banning him from going near Nash's home or contacting her again.The attack came just three days after Alli appeared before magistrates after an altercation with a policeman on the housing estate where Nash lives.On that occasion, magistrates heard he was in a drunken rage when he was asked to leave her house. He was fined £35 and told to pay £100 compensation to the police officer.As well as losing her sight in 2011, Nash was left with a broken jaw and nose in the attack two years ago by 34-year-old Jenkin. He held her prisoner for 12 hours after the assault and blamed her for his actions, telling her he would "do years for this."She later wrote of the attack: "I sat up and reached my hand to my face ... and felt my eyeball hanging halfway down my cheek. I touched my slippery eyeball, like I couldn't believe it was real. My other eye was swollen to the size of a tennis ball."In a Guardian interview at the time of the publication of her book, Nash said: "I thought I was going to lose my kids, I had lost everything. I asked my family to finish me off because I didn't want to be here any more."When I found out I could keep my kids, that it would be discrimination if they were taken away from me, I thought: I can do this. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I can."She has had reconstructive surgery to implant prosthetic eyes, which boosted her confidence and before the latest attack had said she felt she had more energy and was happier than ever.Jenkin remains in custody after an appeal against his life sentence was rejected by high court judges at the end of last year.
