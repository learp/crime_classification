A terminally ill man was beaten up by robbers in a "cowardly attack" as he walked home from the pub.Police do not believe the offenders knew their 69-year-old victim was dying but say they would have known he appeared frail and vulnerable.Two men crept up behind him and then felled him with a blow to the back of the head.They then kicked him in the stomach, stood on his back and emptied his wallet of cash before throwing it back at him.Detectives are appealing for information about the robbery, which took place in Wood Street, Denton, Greater Manchester, just after midnight on 5 August after the man left the Angel pub.The muggers were seen to run off in the direction of Edward Street.The victim needed hospital treatment for two suspected broken ribs.DC Fiona Rigby said: "This was a vicious and cowardly attack on a frail and dying man."He has terminal cancer and is very ill. In fact he doesn't have long to live. One of his remaining pleasures in life is to walk to his local pub for a couple of beers with his friends."Now, because of the despicable actions of these cowards, this modest pleasure has been utterly destroyed."Walking to and from the pub was part of his ritual, no doubt bringing him a modicum of independence. Now he has to get a taxi out of fear."The robbers probably wouldn't have known about his condition, but one look at him would have told them he was frail, vulnerable and clearly not going to put up a fight – precisely why these bullies picked on him, no doubt."I now want everyone to recall whether they were in the area – near the allotments on Wood Street – around midnight on Tuesday 5 August. Did you see anything that could help us?"Also, while the victim lay on the floor being attacked, he saw a black or dark vehicle driving past him up Wood Street in the direction of Greengate Road, Denton. Were you in that car and did you see anything? If so, please get in touch."The attackers are described as about 20 years old, 5ft 8in or 5ft 9in, with local accents. One wore a light grey tracksuit while the other wore a black tracksuit. Both wore their hoods up.Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 9484 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
