Some 320 new places are to be provided in prisons and hospitals for the assessment and treatment of "dangerous" people with severe personality disorder, home secretary Jack Straw has this week announced. The scheme includes a new specialist treatment project at the high security Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire, which will develop a range of new therapeutic treatments, and a new unit at Frankland prison, Co. Durham, which will provide 100 assessment and treatment places. A 70-place unit is also being built at the high security Rampton hospital, with opening scheduled next year. A further 70 places are to be made available within the NHS. The announcement represents the second phase of the government's programme to deal with this group. The first pilot schemes, unveiled last September and located at Whitemoor and Rampton, are designed to research a rigorous assessment tool to help identify those to be included. Straw says Â£126m is being made available over the next three years.
