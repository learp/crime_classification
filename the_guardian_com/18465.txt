Town and city centres are becoming "no-go areas" after dark, with drunken yobs behaving like "an occupying army loose in the streets", the chairman of an influential House of Commons committee said today.Putting the cost of dealing with street disorder in England and Wales at £3.4 billion a year, Edward Leigh called for "absolutely rigorous" action against a hard core of offenders who regarded anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) as "part and parcel of their way of life".His comments came as the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee issued a report warning that a small proportion of families and individuals were causing "misery and despair" to communities, particularly in the most deprived areas.The report criticised the Home Office for its failure to carry out adequate research on which measures work best in tackling and preventing bad behaviour.Different measures - such as Asbos, acceptable behaviour contracts and dispersal orders - are used at varying rates in different parts of the country, with no central information about which work best in which circumstances, it found.Meanwhile, some interventions have scarcely been used, such as individual support orders - issued five times in 2003/4 and 30 times in 2004/5.The report cited a study of 893 cases of official actions to deal with anti-social behaviour, carried out by spending watchdogs the National Audit Office, which found that 65% of people stopped misbehaving after a single intervention - often a simple warning letter.Some 93% of those studied had given up anti-social behaviour after three brushes with the authorities, but a hard core continued regardless.Just 20% of the individuals accounted for more than half of the interventions and, among this group, those with convictions had an average of 50 each.One person had 271 criminal convictions and had breached his Asbo 25 times.The report recorded that communities were "frustrated and concerned" at the courts' failure to act rapidly when Asbos were broken.It called for "rigorous enforcement" of breaches with jail sentences if necessary.Mr Leigh said: "After dark, our city and town centres are fast becoming no-go areas, with behaviour there ranging from drunken skylarking and intimidation to out-and-out criminal activity."No civilised country should have to put up with what can seem like an occupying army loose in the streets. The cost of responding to it is currently running at some £3.4bn a year."A barrage of different anti-social behaviour measures was introduced 10 years ago, but the Home Office has not done any work nationwide to find out which ones work best."The National Audit Office found evidence that, for many tearaways, a simple and cheap warning letter was enough to deter further bad behaviour. But the Government has not collected any information on the effectiveness of different measures on different groups of offenders."A hard core of persistent offenders clearly regards Asbos as part and parcel of its way of life and to be shrugged off accordingly."Enforcement action against these people must be absolutely rigorous and, where they persist in their breaches of orders, there should be no hesitation in bringing prosecutions. Cases should also be considered for referral to the Crown Court, which can impose custodial sentences."And we need to try to head off a new generation of persistent offenders, by directing appropriate support at families whose youngsters are at risk of falling into anti-social behaviour."Today's report said 10 years after the introduction of the first anti-social behaviour measures, no national evaluation of their effectiveness had been undertaken.It said data that the Home Office did provide to the NAO on public perceptions of anti-social behaviour turned out to be incorrect and had to be revised.The cross-party committee noted that these were the latest of "several recent examples by the Home Office of its poor quality information systems and data", following previous inaccurate or missing statistics on foreign prisoners and British citizens jailed abroad.Home Secretary Jacqui Smith needs to "change attitudes within the department" in order to address such problems and rebuild public confidence, the report said.It called on the Home Office to develop a national scheme for evaluation of different approaches to anti-social behaviour in order to provide clear, evidence-based recommendations to local authorities and police of what works best in different circumstances.Little-used measures such as individual support orders should be reviewed for possible abolition, it said.Mr Leigh added: "The Home Office is notorious for a number of recent episodes where it provided duff information. The fact that it supplied the NAO with incorrect data on perceptions around the country of anti-social behaviour does nothing to improve its reputation. The department should pull itself together."
