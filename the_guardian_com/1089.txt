Nearly 90,000 knives including samurai swords, axes and machetes were handed in during the five-week national knife amnesty that ended last month, the Home Office announces today. Devon and Cornwall police even took delivery of an M72 rocket launcher.Most of the 89,864 blades were deposited in sealed red bins at police stations. They included cut-throat razors, meat cleavers and an 1880s bayonet. Home Office minister Vernon Coaker praised the response: "Those who carry knives must understand the weapons can be turned on them and that knives don't make anyone safer."
