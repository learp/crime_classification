The government last night faced fresh embarrassment over lost personal data, after admitting that a disc containing the DNA details of thousands of suspected foreign criminals was mislaid for a year.Whitehall sources said the disc, containing the details of 2,000 suspects wanted by the Dutch authorities, lay on a desk at the Crown Prosecution Service for a year after being "ignored" by officials. The CPS insisted there had been no breach of security, because the disc never left its premises after being sent to Britain by the Dutch authorities in January last year.But the Tories accused the government of endangering the British public because 11 of the suspects allegedly committed crimes in Britain before the CPS looked at the information. The Dutch authorities sent DNA details of 2,000 people believed to have been involved in unsolved crimes, asking the CPS to match the data against British DNA records.Whitehall sources admitted that the disc lay unnoticed on the desk of a CPS official until last month. "It was just ignored, it sat on someone's desk," one source said. "It did not get lost. It did not leave the building."The checks were carried out last month when the disc was spotted, and found that the records of 15 of the Dutch suspects were on the British database.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: "It beggars belief that after all the disasters that have happened in the government's handling of data it can still lose a disc with the details of serious criminals who are a danger to the British public. This shows it is incapable of learning the lessons of how to handle vital data."A CPS spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that DNA profiles of around 2,000 unknown individuals were sent by a foreign jurisdiction to the CPS to facilitate a check against the national DNA database." Last year Revenue & Customs lost two discs containing the details of half the population.
