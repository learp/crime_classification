A six-year-old boy, left orphaned and crippled after joyriders ploughed into his family's car, features in a harrowing new poster campaign warning of the dangers of car crime.   The parents of Tyler, Charmaine and Justin Watson were killed when their car was hit head-on by speeding joyriders in County Antrim in 1999.  Tyler, who was three at the time of the crash, is the focus of the campaign launched today by Families Bereaved Through Car Crime.  The Belfast-based group is campaigning for tougher sentences for joyriders, or "death drivers", as it prefers to call them.  The organisation is made up of eight families, who have had members killed in joyriding-related accidents.  The poster features photographs of the victims, including Tyler's mother and father, placed around the main picture of Tyler.  The accident ruptured the boy's spleen and diaphragm, broke his jaw and left him with a permanent limp.  Tommy Holland, the spokesman for the group, said he hoped the campaign - which he agreed was "disturbing" - would influence politicians, judges, the police and potential joyriders.   "The situation at the moment is that death drivers get locked up for a couple of months and get out again," he said.   "We're looking for higher sentences being made available to judges and for judges to actually implement these."  The group has lobbied the Northern Ireland Office minister, Des Browne, and Northern Ireland court service.   Last week the Home Office minister, Lord Falconer, promised to meet the group in London and listen to its demands.  Tyler's guardians, Jason and Joanne Watson, said the child had agreed to take part in the campaign.   "It's a really harrowing poster and, if I wasn't involved with it, it would make me feel uncomfortable. But it is the best way to get the message across," said Mrs Watson.
