Four years ago, Labour pledged to cut crime and bring more offenders to justice, with particular emphasis on street crime, burglary and robbery.Things are moving slowly but surely in the right direction in Enfield.Total crime is down 4.3% since 2001, and detection rates are up from 13.1% in 2001 to 18.9% in the past 12 months, although the borough commander, Chief Superintendent Simon O'Brien, wants an overall 20% crime reduction in the next three years and 25-28% detection rates.While drugs and vandalism still permeate Enfield's pockets of deprivation, Labour strategies of more officers on the beat, tackling persistent offenders, and creating more effective partnerships between police and other public bodies appear to be paying off.Police, local Labour MPs, the Conservative-led council, and community groups are all in favour of a more visible, accessible police presence. Ruth Ward, of the Neighbourhood Watch Association and Crime and Disorder Partnership Board, believes street patrols provide public reassurance and allow officers to build up useful knowledge.The government's Safer Neighbourhoods scheme, which aims to put a dedicated team of one sergeant, two con stables and three community support officers (CSOs) into each council ward, is taking shape. While some residents still feel neglected, it covers five of Enfield's 21 wards, with three more following soon.Catching perpetrators is only part of the story. It is an ambitious long-term challenge, never going to be complete in a mere four years, but police and residents recognise that a safer environment requires a holistic approach, with wide-ranging public input to educate and divert people away from offending.The vast majority of persistent offenders are addicts, and Mr O'Brien is sure that Claverings, an innovative drug referral centre opened in Edmonton last week, will prove a positive example of joined-up services working to break the drugs/crime cycle.National research suggests that 7% of offenders are responsible for 80% of crime. Enfield detectives have identi fied 35 prolific offenders: 22 adults all with serious drug problems, and 13 juveniles.Of the 22, 17 have agreed to consider Claverings's fast-track treatment, medication and counselling. Those who refuse can expect harsh treatment if they come before a magistrate.But police say that weaning even one or two addicts, some of whom steal five or six times a day, off drugs would dramatically reduce car crime, burglary and robbery.Drawing young people away from knife culture is another ambition. A recent surrender yielded 40 blades, and police officers recount anecdotes of uneasy teenagers shoving weapons down backs of seats after public safety lectures.Others feel their efforts are not so well received. Enfield's Victim Support manager Rasheed Sadegh-Zadeh wrote to 60 local schools, offering to talk to pupils. Only one has replied so far.
