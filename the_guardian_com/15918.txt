Scotland Yard officers are preparing to publicly blame each other for the mistakes that led to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell tube station, senior sources have told the Guardian.Allies of the commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, fear such a public falling out at the inquest into the killing, which starts in September, will lead to the jury returning an unlawful killing verdict. That, in turn, would put renewed pressure on Blair to quit over the shooting dead of the innocent man mistaken for a terrorist.At the inquest into the shooting, which happened three years ago today, members of the surveillance team and the firearms unit are expected to blame each other for blunders that led to the killing of the Brazilian electrician. Firearms officers are expected to tell the inquest that their colleagues in surveillance had positively identified the man they were following as a wanted terrorist.Surveillance team members will deny this and say they had expected firearms officers from CO19 unit to be in place to stop the suspect before he entered the tube station.Firearms and surveillance officers are retaining separate lawyers, as are senior officers in command of the flawed operation that killed De Menezes.De Menezes was shot dead by officers who mistook him for the suicide bomber who had tried to kill civilians on a tube train the previous day.The electrician was followed by surveillance officers from his south London home to Stockwell tube station, where after boarding a train he was held down by a surveillance officer and repeatedly shot in the head by members of CO19.A report from the Metropolitan Police Authority last week said Scotland Yard bosses still did not know what caused the catastrophic errors that led to the killing. It also said officers involved had not yet been fully debriefed.Today sees the third anniversary of the death, which will be commemorated by the Menezes family and supporters.Three senior allies of the commissioner have told the Guardian that the inquest may prove so disastrous that Blair will finally lose his battle to cling on to his job.The sources have been supportive of the commissioner since the Stockwell crisis began. One said: "An unlawful killing verdict will lead to significant pressure on the commissioner and his job."Last year the Met was found guilty at a criminal trial of gross errors leading to the death, but Blair survived resignation calls from Tories and Liberal Democrats, leading him to liken his survival powers to those of "a limpet".The government has considered what would happen if Blair had to be replaced before his term as commissioner expires in January 2010. One scenario would see his deputy, Sir Paul Stephenson, fill the post until a permanent replacement was found. Stephenson would be free to apply for the post on a full-time basis.Frontrunners to become commissioner include Merseyside's chief constable, Bernard Hogan-Howe, and Sir Hugh Orde, head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.Senior sources also say Blair will not get an extension to his term as commissioner if he was to ask the government for one.
