The Conservatives are proposing an expansion of so-called boot camps to rehabilitate young offenders, it emerged today.The proposal was one of many to come out of a one day conference on youth crime organised by the Tories at Westminster today, attended by around 100 representatives of youth groups and charities and senior policemen, including the assistant deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Brian Paddick.The summit was looking at how to prevent young people becoming victims or perpetrators of crime. The Tories are considering implementing the Swedish system of "restorative justice" should they win the next election, in which law students mentor youth victims of crime through the judicial system.Opening the conference, the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said he was taking as his boot camp model a British scheme called C-Far, which offers residential rehabilitation courses for young male offenders after they leave prison.Run by a former royal marine lieutenant-colonel, Trevor Philpott, who was also at the seminar, the courses impose military discipline on repeat offenders in an 11-week residential programme, followed by nine months of intensive support on release.According to government figures, in 1999 81% of young offenders between 10 and 17 who had served a custodial sentence were convicted again within two years of release.The shadow home office minister, Cheryl Gillan, said: "We're looking very closely at these early experiments."It's too late to say if this would be rolled out nationally, but what is clearly true is that we need to go down to the personal level with youth offenders. What will work for one may not be right for another."There is no point to the current situation, where we say to drug-addicted young offenders: 'There's a rehabilitation place for you ... in three months' time."Ms Gillan told the conference audience she had been impressed by a Swedish model for helping young victims of crime.She said: "Young people are far more likely to have been the victim of crime than to be the perpetrator. I'm looking at Sweden, where all under-18s receive victim support ... and then law students accompany them through the judicial stages." For the Metropolitan police, Mr Paddick - who introduced a cannabis "tolerance zone" in Brixton three years ago - praised the government's focus on anti-social behaviour, saying that groups of intimidating youngsters misbehaving "affect hundreds of people as opposed to a burglary, which affects one". He said he would, however, like to see more mediation between youths and residents before antisocial behaviour orders were imposed."A Tory spokesman later insisted the young offenders residential centres were not 'boot camps' as the criminals would be free to leave at any time - although they would be subject to a strict regime of exercise and community programmes."According to one recent survey, young people are twice as likely to be victims of crime as adults. There are 13,000 15-to-21-year-olds incarcerated in England and Wales.
