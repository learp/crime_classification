"Home taping is killing music," the record labels chanted almost 30 years ago. The plea fell on deaf ears: the techniques for getting something for nothing have become ever more complex with the universality of the internet over the past 10 years. Napster was a piece of software that allowed people around the world to swap songs with each other by clicking a button on their computer. The company was eventually sued in 2000, leading not only to Napster's closure but also heralding a sequence of court cases against the multitude of filesharing services that were springing up.One of the most popular, Grokster, was closed in 2005 after a US supreme court ruling, while Australia forced another well-known service, Kazaa, to agree a settlement with the music industry worth more than $100m (about Â£67m). Despite these cases, however, the proliferation of copyrighted material online has multiplied.Downloading larger files like movies has become easier as broadband gets faster, and the complex system known as Bittorrent - which is used by The Pirate Bay - is now thought to be responsible for more than 40% of all internet traffic.At the same time, sites like YouTube have come under fire for allowing people to put copyrighted material online. Media conglomerate Viacom is in the middle of a $1bn lawsuit against Google, which owns YouTube, claiming it does not do enough to prevent infringement.
