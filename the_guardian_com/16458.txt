Benji Webbe, the singer of the reggae-metal band Skindred, will be scarred “for the rest of my life” after being stabbed in the face and throat with a broken glass in his hometown of Newport, south Wales, in the early hours of 31 January.Webb posted photos of large scars stretching up the left side of his throat and around his left eye on his Facebook page. He had been attending a friend’s birthday party, where he performed a reggae version of David Bowie’s Life on Mars. He and his girlfriend were attacked on the way home, and his girlfriend was “dragged around and spat at by a group of women who glassed me”.Webbe gave details of the incident to Wales Online. On leaving the party at the Lounge club in Newport, he and his girlfriend passed a group of women who were arguing and he jokingly told them to calm down. “One of the women turned to me and came within four inches of my face, screaming and shouting,” he said. Another, who had fallen and broken her glass, stood up, and Webbe then thought she slapped him. But another observer told Webbe he was bleeding from his face and throat. He was taken to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital for treatment.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest “Every time I talked, the gash would open further,” Webbe told Wales Online. “The nurse said it was definitely glass. It was about two inches from my jugular vein. At first, I didn’t realise the seriousness of the damage. I could have not been here today.”Webbe said Newport remained a “great community” and he would not be cowed from going out. However, he said all clubs should serve drinks in plastic glasses and bottles.Gwent Police have appealed for anyone with information about the incident to come forward.Skindred have released six albums since 2002 and, in 2011, won the Metal Hammer award for best live band.
