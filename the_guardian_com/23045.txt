A 45-year-old man who was tasered by police at the end of a two-day armed siege has been charged with firearms offences, police have said. The standoff at a home in Norwich ended after 32 hours of negotiations, according to the Norfolk constabulary.The incident was resolved on Saturday afternoon when the occupants emerged one by one. Police shot David Cawston with a Taser stun gun when he emerged from the house in order to "effect a safe and secure arrest", a spokesman said. Officers charged Cawston with two counts of possession of an air weapon with intent to cause fear or violence.
