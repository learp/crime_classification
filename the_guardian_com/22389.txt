The family of a woman bludgeoned to death at her home in southwest London on Wednesday have said witnesses must come forward for the 'protection of the British public'.Relatives of Laila Rezk, who may have been followed home by her killer, said she was their 'beautiful princess'. In a statement released through the police they added: 'She is now safe with God, but the awful person who did this remains free to commit such evil again. For this reason, we cannot stress enough how important any information that anyone may have, will be for the protection of the British public. Her life, like all others, is priceless, so please come forward if you can contribute anything at all.'Police also released CCTV footage last night showing the 51-year-old mother of two, minutes before she was attacked. Officers searching for the killer hope the image of her at the bottom of the stairs of a bus will help them retrace her final steps. A post-mortem examination found that she died from head injuries.Rezk, a client services manager for an in-flight entertainment company, left her office in central London as normal. She was on the bus at 7.27pm. Police believe she got off 15 minutes later and walked down Robin Hood Lane, possibly trailed by her killer. She put up a desperate fight for her life before being found in a pool of blood by her son and daughter. Anyone who thinks they saw her on the bus should call Crimestoppers 0800 555111.
