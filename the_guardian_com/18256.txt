The British hacker who broke into the Pentagon's and Nasa security systems today won a two-week stay on his extradition to the US.Gary McKinnon, 42, lost his House of Lords appeal against the extradition last month, but today he was granted a stay until August 28 by the European court of human rights.McKinnon, dubbed "the world's most dangerous hacker" by the American authorities, faces up to 70 years in prison and his solicitors say he could even be given "enemy combatant" status, the same as that applied to terrorist suspects held at Guantánamo Bay.A brief statement released by McKinnon's lawyers said he had been granted "interim relief" until August 28 "for his application to be heard before the full chamber".His application to halt his extradition will argue that his human rights would be infringed if he is sent to the US.McKinnon argues that he cannot be granted a fair trial in the US, after American officials involved in the case allegedly told him they wanted to see him "fry".The unemployed UFO fan hacked into 97 computers belonging to the US military shortly after the attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon in 2001, using the codename "Solo". American officials claim he infiltrated systems belonging to the department of defence, the US armed forces and even Nasa - causing $700,000 (£354,000) damage and threatening national security.McKinnon has consistently argued that he was just a "bumbling computer nerd" who caused no damage and was merely searching for evidence to prove his theories that the CIA had covered up the existence of aliens.He has never denied that he infiltrated the military security systems, but has always maintained that he was motivated by curiosity and only managed to get into the networks because of lax security.
