Prison authorities missed 14 potential opportunities to prevent a known racist psychopath from murdering his Asian cellmate, a public inquiry heard today.The Zahid Mubarek inquiry was told of a catalogue of official errors and oversights that may have led to a failure to identify the danger that murderer Robert Stewart posed to his 19-year-old victim, whom he bludgeoned to death at Feltham young offenders' institution, west London, in March 2000.Errors included five potential missed opportunities to clarify the risks Stewart posed and to address his serious mental disorder, and nine key turning points in the days before the murder when Feltham staff could have averted the tragedy, said counsel to the inquiry, Nigel Giffin QC."It can certainly be said, looking back now, that Stewart was a potential danger to anyone with whom he might come into contact, and it may be that he was particularly dangerous to anyone who belonged to an ethnic minority," said the QC in his opening statement.Mr Giffin said one of the potential warning signs was that Stewart had been involved in, but not responsible for, the murder of another prisoner in Stoke Heath prison, Shropshire, in June 1998.Mr Giffin said the inquiry would have to consider whether this should not have led the prison service to assess the future risk Stewart might pose given that on average there are only two prisoner homicides per year.One of the key incidents in the days before the killing was that two standard "locks, bolts and bars" searches of Stewart and Mubarek's cell had not apparently uncovered a broken table leg, which was later used as the murder weapon. Staff failed to spot that one piece of the table had been fashioned into a dagger.The QC outlined several other key missed opportunities to address Stewart's disturbed mental state and behaviour. It appeared that his diagnosis of a severe personality disorder and propensity to violence was not properly recorded, nor did he undergo a full psychiatric assessment.The racist views Stewart expressed in letter intercepted by Feltham prison officers were also not recorded in the institute's security files. In one letter, sent the month before the murder, he wrote: "If I don't get bail (...) I'll take xtreme (sic) measures to get shipped out, kill me fuckin padmate if I have to, bleach me sheets and pillowcase white and make a Ku Klux Klan outfit and walk out of me pad wiv (sic) a flaming crucifix."In his witness statement to the inquiry, Stewart claimed that racial prejudice played some part in the murder. The killer claimed that he attacked Mubarek to get "shipped out of Feltham, an establishment which he clearly disliked intensely, intending to injure but not to kill him," said Mr Giffin. But he added: "There are obvious questions about the plausibility of that account, given the degree of violence used."The QC said that the inquiry needed to assess whether any failures to protect Mubarek were the product of racial discrimination. There were allegations that some Feltham prison officers had deliberately placed white and ethnic minority inmates into the same cell in the expectation that they would fight.Mubarek, of Walthamstow, east London, was just hours from release after serving three months for theft, when Stewart, of Hattersley, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, killed him. Stewart, now 24, is serving a life sentence for the murder.The inquiry is expected to continue until March.
