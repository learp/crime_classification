Former nightclub bouncer Carl Whant has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 35 years for the rape and murder of heavily pregnant teenager Nikitta Grender.Grender, 19, was two weeks away from giving birth when Carl Whant, who had been taking drugs, called at her flat at around 5am on 5 February last year.Whant raped the mother-to-be, who was the girlfriend of his closest friend and cousin, Ryan Mayes, then slashed her throat and stabbed her in the abdomen.In an attempt to disguise his crimes, he then set fire to her home in Newport, south Wales, which was ready for the imminent arrival of baby Kelsey May.The blaze also claimed the life of Grender's pet dog, which burned slowly for two hours before it was discovered by a neighbour.Despite throwing away the murder weapon, Whant, 27, of Bettws, near Newport, was caught after DNA evidence was found at the scene and in his car.Whant had claimed he had consensual sex with Grender just hours before her death.The jury at Newport crown court rejected his explanation that the reason he was driving near Grender's flat near sunrise was to "pick up fags" from his grandmother's house.Whant was found guilty of murder, rape, child destruction and arson.He appeared to yawn as the four unanimous guilty verdicts were delivered.Mayes looked at Whant and shook his head at each verdict.
