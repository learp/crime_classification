The grandmother of five-year-old Ellie Lawrenson, who was mauled to death by a dog on New Year's Day, was today charged with her manslaughter.Jacqueline Simpson, 46, was also charged with possession of a controlled drug, the Crown Prosecution Service said.The child's uncle, Kiel Simpson, was charged with possession of a dangerous dog, under section one of the Dangerous Dogs Act.Ellie was killed at her grandmother's home in St Helens, Merseyside. Ms Simpson needed emergency surgery for arm injuries after she was attacked by the same dog, which police later shot dead.Colin Davies, of Merseyside CPS, said: "Having carefully considered all of the material supplied by Merseyside police, I made the decision that there was sufficient evidence and authorised that Kiel Simpson should be charged with the possession of a dangerous dog, namely a pit bull terrier, and Jackie Simpson with the manslaughter of Ellie Lawrenson and possession of a controlled drug, diamorphine."The pair will appear before magistrates on April 11.The CPS said Ms Simpson had been charged with manslaughter due to gross negligence, meaning lawyers would have to prove she had a duty of care towards Ellie, that she was grossly negligent in breaching that duty and that this had led to her granddaughter's death.
