Colin Pritchard ('The fear is not in step with reality', G2, 4 March) was right to highlight the much greater threat posed by motor vehicles to children than "child killers". Road crashes are the leading cause of death for children aged between five and 14. We agree that enforcement of 20mph speed limits in residential areas would save more lives of children. It is "speedophiles", rather than paedophiles, that parents should be worried about. But while pointing out the media's complicity in distorting perceptions of risk, Professor Pritchard's use of the prejudicial term of "accident", rather than the more neutral "collision", only perpetuates the complacency towards the seven deaths on our roads every day. We believe a shift to this more neutral terminology is overdue.Amy Aeron-ThomasExecutive director, RoadPeace
