The home secretary, David Blunkett, will urge lawyers today to work with government to stamp out the "culture of adjournment and delay" that wastes more than Â£80m a year in the criminal courts.Mr Blunkett has angered lawyers by blaming them for causing delays in the courts, and accusing them of playing procedural games to the detriment of justice. But today, addressing the law society's conference in Manchester, he is expected to adopt a conciliatory approach, urging lawyers to cooperate in reforming the system for the benefit of victims and witnesses. "A system which sees courts deliberately over booked and 13% of cases discontinued by the crown prosecution service, because cases are inade quately prepared or key participants in the trial fail to turn up, is a system that is failing. Reforming this system must be our priority," he will say. Mr Blunkett will urge solicitors to consider the wider interests of society when carrying out their function as lawyers. He will tell the society, representing the 85,000 solicitors in England and Wales: "I invite members of the legal profession to contribute to the process of making reform of the criminal justice system fair and effective." Mr Blunkett is soliciting the profession's support for the government's forthcoming criminal justice bill, which sets out sweeping changes to the prosecution process. Lawyers oppose some of the changes, including a right for judges to dispense with juries in complex fraud cases, more information for juries on defen dants' previous convictions, and retrospective abolition of the double jeopardy rule thatbars a defendant being tried twice for a crime. "The need for reform cannot be negotiable, and indeed there is wide support for much of our agenda," Mr Blunkett will say. "But where there is disagreement and concern I ask that [you] work with us to ensure new structures are robust and that safeguards are adequate."
