The appointment of John Birt as Tony Blair's 'crime-busting' adviser will not have police officers choking on their canteen-bought bacon sandwiches. This piece of news, although a shock to most, is one more likely to earn weary sighs than table-thumping condemnation.However, the fact the prime minister has chosen Lord Birt, a friend who has no previous experience in policing or criminology, will reinforce the belief among many officers that the government does not really understand the issues - rising crime, fear of crime, rural crime - that have made law and order one of the most contentious policy areas in recent months.Police officers remember that Ian Blair, now deputy commissioner of the Met, once advocated contracting out some policing duties. The view caused uproar. The rank and file want to protect, not diminish, their role in society. They put a question mark against Blair's name which has yet to be erased.So imagine what they are going to make of Lord Birt. To them, he is the bespectacled bean-counter who tried to start a revolution at the BBC: he fussed at management structures, budgets and overstaffing, and was criticised for not investing enough in quality broadcasting. Officers will ask whether he can, working one day a week and starting from scratch, offer a valuable perspective. At this point, the answer has to be a resounding 'no'.There is a chance, however, that he will win them over. Perhaps Downing Street realises that the police and the BBC are institutions with one thing in common - both have tangled themselves up in paralysing bureaucracy.Met commissioner Sir John Stevens says one of his major goals is to streamline Scotland Yard and free his officers from time consuming paperwork so they can go out and catch criminals.Officers want to be unshackled. Perhaps Lord Birt has the key.
