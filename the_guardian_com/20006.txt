The remains of three newborn babies believed to have been hidden since the 1980s have been found by police.Officers made the discovery in the early hours of Sunday at a house in Merseyside after a tip-off.It is believed the babies, found in Thatto Heath, south of St Helens, could have been born as long ago as the mid-1980s.Police have questioned two women, aged 54 and 38, and a 26-year-old man. They have been released pending further inquiries.Merseyside police said forensic tests were being carried out to determine the age and sex of the children."Following a call to us, we attended at an address in St Helens where human remains were discovered," said Detective Superintendent Steve Naylor, who is leading the investigation."The remains are believed to be that of newborn babies ... The investigation has only recently commenced and a number of lines of inquiry are being explored."We cannot speculate as to the cause or circumstances of the deaths and any inappropriate supposition is likely to have a severe impact on the investigation and the family concerned."This looks like being a complex investigation, and a lot of hard work needs to be done before we can ascertain what the full circumstances are surrounding this situation."Lyn Murphy and her partner, Jason Hughes, live next door to the property. "I saw the undertakers bringing in three little boxes into the house, which looked like children's coffins," Murphy, 44, told the Liverpool Daily Post."When they came out they had only two boxes, which were stacked on top of each other and were inside another cardboard box. I believe the bodies were in the attic, because I heard the police making noises upstairs as they were searching the house. The attics in these houses are very close together."Hughes, 38, said: "When the police first entered the house I heard a bit of arguing and raised voices. They [the boxes] were no more than a metre long â€‘ one was blue, one was grey and one was pink. One had a drawing of a teddy bear on it and another one had one of flowers."Electoral records show that a number of people have lived in the house in recent years.
