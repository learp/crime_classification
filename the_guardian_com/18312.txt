The head of the prison service, Phil Wheatley, will try to explain to the home secretary today how a burglar shot by farmer Tony Martin came to be released from prison just days before the farmer was due to walk free.Martin, who will enjoy his first taste of liberty this morning, has reacted angrily to the news that Brendan Fearon was freed on Friday, less than a third of the way into an 18-month term for heroin dealing, under a scheme to ease pressure on over-crowded jails. Martin's MP, Henry Bellingham, accused the authorities of "putting the boot in" because they were angry that the farmer had become a cause celebre since the shooting at his home in which Fearon, 33, was injured and his 16-year-old accomplice, Fred Barras, was killed. Mr Bellingham, MP for north-west Norfolk, said: "I think there are people in the Home Office who deeply resent the fact that Tony Martin has attracted so much publicity." Martin was moved from his prison on Thursday and has been staying at a secret location, partly to ensure his security .He has served three years of a five-year sentence for manslaughter, after his original life sentence for murder was reduced on appeal. Fearon and Martin are due to meet in the high court next year when the burglar sues the farmer for damages. However, Fearon is reportedly considering dropping the action. The Home Office minister Paul Goggins said there was no reason to suspect Fearon's release was handled improperly. He said David Blunkett had asked for a report because he was seeking full information about a high-profile case.
