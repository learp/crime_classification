The Home Office refused to apologise yesterday for wrongly labelling 1,500 innocent people as criminals because of errors in the bureau which identifies whether individuals have convictions.People working in positions of trust with children or vulnerable adults routinely have their names run through a criminal records bureau (CRB) check to ensure they do not have any convictions that would make them unsuitable for the post. But it emerged yesterday that errors in the cross-checking of names had resulted in 1,500 innocent people being wrongly labelled as pornographers, thieves or violent robbers, in some cases resulting in their being turned down for jobs or university places.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, branded the Home Office the ministry of incompetence for the latest blunders in the CRB, and said he had been warning about the problems in the service since David Blunkett was home secretary.A Home Office spokesman said the errors were regrettable but in the context of the vast scale of work carried out by the CRB they amounted to 0.03% of the 9m disclosures issued by the bureau since it started operating four years ago.The spokesman said the mistakes were a result of "mismatches" which arose when the bureau was carrying out checks on people applying for jobs working in positions of trust with children or vulnerable adults. "Last year CRB checks prevented 25,000 unsuitable people from gaining such positions, and customer satisfaction is now at an all-time high," the spokesman said. "We make no apology for erring on the side of caution. We are talking about the protection of children and vulnerable adults."
