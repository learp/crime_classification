Police are searching three locations as part of an investigation into raids in which cash machines were blown open with explosives.Merseyside police said there had been six such attacks on ATMs in their area since May, with the latest taking place in Prescot on Thursday.Det Supt Chris Green said: "These incidents are being thoroughly investigated by a dedicated team of specialist officers."There have been similar attacks in other parts of the country and we are working with other forces to identify if there are any similarities between the incidents."If these people are crossing force boundaries to commit these crimes, the public can be reassured that we are linked in with other forces and together we are determined to bring these offenders to justice."Only two weeks ago a car believed to be involved in two of these incidents was recovered in an industrial premises in Knowsley as part of the ongoing investigation. The vehicle is currently undergoing extensive forensic examination in a bid to identify those involved and it has already provided us with some proactive leads."We are continuing to use resources available to us such as technology and forensics in our investigations into these attacks. Through our inquiries we have gained an understanding of the methods being used by these offenders in the execution of these crimes."This type of crime is still rare on Merseyside and these incidents have been opportunistic and have taken place when the banks have been closed and at times when there has been no one around. But with that said, the actions of these individuals are still dangerous and extremely reckless."Those responsible, when caught, could face life imprisonment if charged with recklessly endangering life or conspiracy to commit explosions."The public are our eyes and ears and if anyone sees anyone acting suspiciously in the vicinity of a bank/ATM we would urge them to contact us, as their information could be vital in bringing these offenders to justice."Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police on 0151 -777 5687 or Crimestoppers on 0800-555 111.
