Two former welfare secretaries have criticised the government for floating plans to withdraw benefits from those convicted of rioting but not sent to jail.Peter Lilley, who was the social security secretary in the last Conservative government, said he did not think it would be legal for the government to withdraw benefits from offenders in the way suggested by the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith.David Blunkett, who held the work and pensions brief and other cabinet posts under Tony Blair, suggested that the idea was an example of "irrational policy-making".Offenders who go to jail already lose their benefits, and Duncan Smith said on Monday that he was considering extending this principle."I'm at the moment looking to see whether or not someone who is convicted of a criminal offence but not custodial, that we would be able to impose a similar process on them as well, that they would lose their benefits for a particular period of time relevant to that process," he said.Duncan Smith seemed to be responding to a petition on the government's new e-petition website saying "convicted London rioters should lose all benefits". The petition has attracted more than 214,000 signatures, making it by far the most popular on the site and meaning that MPs will consider debating it in parliament because it has passed the 100,000-signature threshold.In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday, Lilley said he did not think the government could withdraw benefits from rioters in this way under the present law.He said that he thought it would be possible to order benefit inspectors to review claims made by people involved in disorder or criminal activity, but suggested the government should be careful about letting an e-petition dictate policy."The reason we have parliament is so we don't have people signing a petition that then makes the law," he said. "That can prompt a debate, and in parliament you get all these arguments. We can then point out the difficulties and the opportunities without a knee-jerk reaction."On the same programme, Blunkett also criticised the Duncan Smith proposal, saying: "Punishment and the issue of what we pay you to live on needs to be separated out, because otherwise we're going to get in a real muddle."We're debating irrational financial markets, irrational policy-making … I've got a lot of time for Iain Duncan Smith, but let's examine what this would exactly mean."What we do with people who we don't send to prison, hopefully, is to put more emphasis on restorative justice where, yes, they do get paid benefit if they don't hold their job, but we expect them to do something for it. It's the something for something that I'm interested in – the proper conditionality that if you can work, you should work."In its response to the e-petition, the government said: "Prisoners convicted of a criminal offence and detained in prison are not entitled to social security benefits."That means that anyone who is eligible for social security benefits and who is caught, convicted and imprisoned for any offence committed during the recent disorder that has disrupted London and other UK cities will be disqualified from receiving social security payments."The department for work and pensions is also looking at whether further sanctions can be imposed on the benefit entitlements of individuals who receive non-custodial sentences. In addition, the department is considering increasing the level of fines which can be deducted from benefit entitlement."Although Duncan Smith has publicly floated the idea of removing benefits from offenders who are not sent to jail, he has also expressed reservations about his own department being involved."I am inclined to believe that it's better if it's done through the judiciary rather than done straight by the department itself," he said on Monday.At a news conference on Tuesday, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, played down the prospects of anything happening quickly."We are going to take our time to look at this," he said. "Of course you need to be proportionate, of course you need to be careful, of course you don't want to create unintended consequences where the taxpayer ends up footing more of the bill or we create more social problems or problems of law and order."
