The lonely life of a would-be nurse who turned to street prostitution and was found dead in Bradford was briefly forgotten today as hundreds of neighbours filled her local church.The mother of Suzanne Blamires, one of three sex workers allegedly killed in Bradford by Stephen Griffiths, 40, a criminology student, spoke of her "endless heartache" over the loss of her daughter and the brutal way she died.A white coffin covered with flowers was carried in a hearse drawn by four plumed horses to St Columba's Catholic church, next to the primary school where Blamires first told friends of her plans for a nursing career.Nicky Blamires, who earlier called Suzanne "a bright and articulate girl who took the wrong path," read a poem referring to happier times in the 36-year-old's life.She emphasised a couplet: "We are not gathered in a gloom-filled room, there are no heads bowed low / We are thinking about how much we love you, and how hard it is to let you go."The theme was taken up by the parish priest, Father Frank Smith, after 40 family and friends followed the cortege and joined 200 other mourners in the church."Today is a day for Nicky and her family to find some peace and be allowed to grieve in private," he said. "As a parish, we offer them our condolences, our prayers and our support in whatever way we can."To lose a child is one of the most difficult things anyone will have to deal with in their lives, but through faith and the support of friends and family, this will hopefully be made a little easier for Suzanne's family."He referred to Blamires, who undertook nursing training, as "a very clever and intelligent woman" who had grown from a child who was "cheeky, full of confidence, outgoing". She had wrapped her father round her little finger, he said, and had been devastated when he died.The remains of Blamires's body were found in the river Aire at Shipley, near Bradford, on 25 May, triggering an investigation that led to divers searching 10 miles of the river. Griffiths has been charged with the murder of Suzanne Blamires, as well as the murder of Shelley Armitage, 31, and Susan Rushworth, 43.Several mourners were in tears as the hearse drew up in front of the church, with flowers in red and white spelling "Suzanne" on one side, and yellow and white blooms saying "sister" on the other. Two of the horses were black; the lead pair were white, topped with red plumes.Nicky Blamires, who is 55, referred to the loss of Suzanne's father in another couplet dedicated to her daughter, who was known to friends as Suey. She told mourners: "We thought we understood heartache. It has landed on our door before / But the pain and loss at losing you, Suzanne, will live with us forever more."She added: "But we take comfort as we know you are reunited with your much-loved dad, and it is time to let you go."The coffin left the church to the tune of Robbie Williams's song Angels for a private burial after an hour-long funeral mass. On the pile of wreaths on top of the hearse was one with a message from Blamires's mother: "You were always my shining star."
