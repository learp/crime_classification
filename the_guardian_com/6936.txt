British businesses and consumers are not doing enough to stop identity fraud, it is claimed today.Only 7% of people are confident that the companies they deal with treat their data responsibly, a survey marking the start of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week found.More than nine out of 10 people in the UK (94%) think they are at risk from identity fraud but only 44% regularly check bills and financial statements against receipts and 55% check before responding to emails and calls.Only 56% of British organisations have a comprehensive policy on protecting people's identities. According to CIFAS, the UK's Fraud Prevention Service, in the first three quarters of this year levels of identity fraud were up almost 10% on the same period last year, with 79,871 cases.The BBC sports presenter John Inverdale, a spokesman for the campaign, said: "I discovered from my postman that my mail had been illegally redirected to a house in north London and I was shocked to think that someone had had access to all my mail and credit card details for four weeks. It became more worrying when I started to receive credit card statements in my name from organisations that I had never heard of. Although I resolved the situation in the end, it was extremely stressful."My experience has made me realise just how important it is for people to protect themselves and their businesses from identity fraud. It's not difficult, but it is important to do things like regularly check your credit report, be careful about what information you reveal on social networks and never give out personal information, especially your PIN number. Businesses can also take simple steps to protect themselves such as creating an anti-fraud policy, as well as having a comprehensive IT security policy and securely destroying all sensitive documents."A guide, supported by organisations including the Metropolitan police, the National Fraud Authority and the Federation of Small Businesses, can be found at www.stop-idfraud.co.uk.
