Harold Shipman was suspended from the medical register yesterday and his name is expected to be erased at a special session of the General Medical Council today, which will finally bar the Hyde GP from practising as a doctor 10 days after he was convicted of mass murder.The GMC's lawyers advised the regulatory body last summer that Shipman could not be suspended while a criminal investigation was under way, and negotiations began at that time with the department of health to change the rules. After his conviction, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, told the House of Commons that Shipman was still licensed to practise medicine even though he was in jail. The GMC has moved as fast as its cumbersome regulations allow to bring about the interim suspension of Shipman. The rules dictate that a doctor must have six weeks' notice between the preliminary stage of the disciplinary process and the final public hearing. But the GP's solicitors have written to the GMC to waive the period of notice, which paves the way for his immediate erasure from the register. The move suggests there may be no appeal against conviction. On Wednesday, the GMC's chief executive, Finlay Scott, said Shipman would have to remain under interim suspension if there was any chance of his lawyers taking his case to the appeal court.
