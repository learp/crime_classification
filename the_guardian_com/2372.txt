John Darwin, the canoeist who faked his own death, has revealed details of his scam in a memoir smuggled out of his jail cell, it was reported today.With the help of his wife, Anne, the former prison officer faked his own death in a canoe accident in the North Sea in 2002 to claim £250,000 insurance.He turned up in London in December 2007 claiming to have suffered from amnesia. But a timestamped photograph surfaced of Darwin and his wife smiling in an estate agency in Panama, and it emerged that he had hidden in a next-door bedsit owned by the couple.Extracts from a book in which the 59-year-old explains the background to the scam have been published in the Sun today, prompting anger over how he managed to sneak the manuscript out of jail.Darwin, who is serving a six-year sentence, teamed up with a fraudster he met at Everthorpe jail in east Yorkshire who posed as his lawyer after being freed, according to the paper.The pair were apparently able to exchange uncensored material under "rule 39", which allows for correspondence between prisoners and their legal advisers to be treated as confidential.The Prison Service failed to carry out basic checks that would have revealed Darwin's new "lawyer" was a conman who was freed on licence earlier this year, the paper reported.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it was "wrong for convicted criminals to profit from their crimes"."Prisons have established processes in place for dealing with rule 39, which ensures that the confidential legal relationships between solicitors and their clients are maintained," she said. "We take any allegations that this rule is being breached very seriously and will investigate them."In his memoir – titled The Canoe Man, Panama & Back – Darwin says he contemplated suicide in the face of overwhelming debts but realised it would not solve his financial woes and feared the effect it would have on his wife."The thought of losing everything was more than I could bear," he said."Not only would I think I was a failure in the eyes of Anne but also in the eyes of my two sons, as I would have lost the family home, lost absolutely everything that Anne and I had worked for."He labels the point at which he hit upon the idea of staging his own death as a "Eureka moment"."If we couldn't die, then my crazed brain reasoned, I could pretend to die. Not a job for Anne, she may fluff it completely and end up really dead! For my part, I no longer had a choice – I'd made up my mind to do it for real."After all, I wouldn't be the first man to kill himself because of financial pressures. The only difference in this case was that it would look like an accident."A suicide would be useless – the insurance company wouldn't pay out."The police, a coroner, financial institutions and the couple's two sons, Mark and Anthony, were convinced that Darwin had drowned.Darwin was sentenced to six years and three months in July 2008 after admitting fraud. His wife was jailed for six and a half years for fraud and money laundering.
