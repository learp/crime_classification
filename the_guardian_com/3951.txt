If you (yup, you) use a fake weapon to brutally beat a stranger, and then slit his throat, and then shoot him in the face, and then you assault a little baby, will your heart and blood pump like mad — even if you know that it’s all a trick and the man will suffer no harm and the baby is just a life-like doll? An American experiment sought an answer to that question.You can read about it in a study called Simulating Murder: the Aversion to Harmful Action, published in the journal Emotion. The authors, Fiery Cushman, Kurt Gray, Allison Gaffey and Wendy Berry Mendes, are respectively at Harvard University, the University of Maryland, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of California, San Francisco.They recruited 108 volunteers who either performed or watched a series of what were called “pretend actions”. Some volunteers did innocuous things: (1) hammering an imaginary nail on a block of wood, (2) using a rock to smash a (rubber) nut, (3) using a spray bottle to mist an imaginary plant, (4) using a rubber knife to cut a (cardboard) loaf of bread, and (5) smacking a hand broom against a table to shake out dust.Other volunteers carried out murderous pretend actions — attacks on a “victim” supplied for the purpose. This stooge, they were assured, would be utterly safe.Each volunteer was asked to do five things, in this order: (1) smash the victim’s shin with a hammer, (2) smash the victim’s hand with a rock, (3) discharge a handgun into the victim’s face, (4) draw a knife across the victim’s throat, and (5) smack a baby against a table.The researchers assured the volunteers that no one would be injured. The victim’s shin was just a PVC pipe worn under a fake pant leg; the victim’s hand was a rubber hand placed at the cuff of the shirt and the actual hand was obscured from sight. The handgun was really a weighty metal replica; the knife just a rubber knife; the baby was  just a realistic looking baby doll.Whatever the volunteers did — whether whacking nails or smashing babies — was while wired to sensors that measured and recorded their blood pressure and cardiac electrical activity.The volunteers who performed the nasty deeds had greater heart rate and blood pressure changes than the volunteers who only watched, and much greater than those who performed non-murderous actions.The researchers concluded that even when people anticipate no one getting hurt, they can get physiologically jazzed from performing murderous acts – or even from seeing them.Marc Abrahams is editor of the Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize
