The investigation into the Moors murders was reopened yesterday, 36 years after Myra Hindley and Ian Brady were convicted, amid claims there might have been a third killer.Christine Slater, 51, from Derbyshire, is convinced the killers were with another man when they allegedly tried to abduct her in Denton, Manchester, when she was 13. The breakthrough came last month when she was reading about Hindley's death, which jogged her memory of events in August 1964. Greater Manchester police confirmed yesterday they were taking her claims seriously and she had been interviewed. The third man, who cannot be named, allegedly tried to drag her into the car. She believes she managed to escape because her Alsatian, Kim, attacked the man. "The man in the back asked me the way to Belle Vue," she told the Manchester Evening News yesterday. "I pointed the way and he asked if I wanted to come with them. "The woman, who I later realised was Myra Hindley, was just looking straight ahead saying nothing. The other man said 'come' - but I told him I didn't want to go to Belle Vue. He then said: 'You'll have a good time with us,' and then Brady added something like: 'Oh, come on.'"At that moment the second man half-stepped out of the car from the back seat and grabbed my right arm. The dog launched himself at him. Even though Kim had his arm, he held on to me." A bystander had shouted at the man to let her go. She had told the dog to leave off, and the car had driven off. She saw pictures of Brady and Hindley in the newspapers after their arrest and realised it was the couple in the abduction attempt. But she did not tell police at the time.
