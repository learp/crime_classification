Up to half of Rape Crisis centres in England and Wales are facing closure within the next year because of severe funding problems, charities said today.Thousands of the estimated 80,000 women who suffer rape or attempted rape every year will be left without vital support if more centres close their doors, campaigners warn, in a crisis partly caused by government failure to provide consistent support.One Rape Crisis centre manager expecting to close her facility, in High Wycombe, within days said women looking for long-term counselling and support would turn instead to doctors for antidepressants or end up within the mental health system.Rape Crisis's prediction that as many as half of its 32 centres in England and Wales will either close or drastically cut back their services this year comes as a powerful coalition of charities blamed the problem on "government failures" to deliver on promises of stable funding for voluntary organisations.The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) said delays in administering the Â£1.25m Victims Fund, a Ministry of Justice pot distributing cash to organisations working with victims of sexual violence and abuse, had left many Rape Crisis centres in limbo, not knowing whether they would be able to continue to operate or whether to make staff redundant.Voluntary bodies have only just learned whether their funding applications have been successful, over two months into the financial year. At least five Rape Crisis centres have been told their Victims Fund grant will not be renewed.Cristina Diamondopoulis, the director of the Rape Crisis centre in High Wycombe, said the news that the centre will not get money from the fund this year was "the final straw".She said: "We are facing closure within a few weeks. We got money last year, have had no bad feedback on our monitoring and were encouraged to apply again, but now we have had the rug pulled from under our feet."The centre's face-to-face and phone counselling services, self-help group and befriending service, as well as Asian and youth outreach workers would all have to close, leaving a gap in services throughout south Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Bedfordshire, she said."It is a scandal that funding for suriviors of sexual crimes is so piecemeal and unsustained. It seems that the lives of survivors are not important to national government."Nicole Westmarland, the chairwoman of Rape Crisis in England and Wales said the organisation "really is at crisis point now". Only 32 centres remain compared with 84 in 1985, and there are just two small, local groups to serve the whole of London.Half of the centres believed they were vulnerable to closure this year, Dr Westmarland said. Many had set six month budgets because delays in allocating the Victims Fund left them uncertain whether they could continue to operate.Government claims to be committed to dealing with rape, for which conviction rates are a mere 5.3% of reported cases, rang hollow without support for victims, she added.NCVO said the problems facing Rape Crisis centres highlighted the "fragility" of funding for small charities, and called for emergency funding to bail out organisations facing closure and three-year funding in future.The government rejected the criticism. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: "The Victims Fund was not established to substitute for local long-term core funding. The intention behind the grant scheme is to provide small injections of funding for a whole range of initiatives and projects that support victims and witnesses. We have been extremely clear that funding was only for one year and successful organisations accepted the grant on those conditions."
