A police officer who caught a pensioner driving a luxury car at 147mph on a bypass has described the incident as the worst case of excessive speed he has witnessed.Company director Owen Swift, 68, was clocked travelling at more than twice the speed limit in his Jaguar XKR on the Malton bypass, North Yorkshire, on the evening of 11 June last year. He was caught by Sergeant John Clayton using a laser speed gun.North Yorkshire police confirmed Swift was found guilty of speeding at Scarborough magistrates court on Wednesday after his claim that he was not the driver of the car was rejected.A force spokeswoman said he was fined £700, ordered to pay £650 costs and an administration fee of £15. He received six penalty points, which were added to six points already on his licence, and he was therefore disqualified from driving for nine months under the "totting" rules.Speaking after the case, Clayton said: "This is the worst case of excessive speed I have ever seen in 26 years of policing. Swift's disregard for his own safety and the safety of other road users beggars belief. The potential consequences of such shocking driving do not bear thinking about."I have seen first hand the destruction caused by excessive speed. Swift should consider himself extremely lucky to be here to face the court and walk away with just a ban and a fine."
