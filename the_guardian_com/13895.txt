Christmas presents destined for sick children in an intensive care unit have been stolen from a hospital.Police were called to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London on Monday after a report that up to 20 wrapped presents were taken.The presents, which had been bought from the hospital's charity fund, included portable DVD players, DVDs, Nintendo DS games consoles, games and toys.They were stolen between Friday and Monday, and were taken from a private area of the hospital, the Metropolitan police said.Inspector Neal Anderson said: "To steal presents that were supposed to be for children too sick to be at home with their families at Christmas is beyond belief."I would urge anyone who has information about the individual, or persons responsible, to contact officers so that we can try and get the items back before Christmas Day."I would also urge the thief to try and think about their actions and do the decent thing and return them."Officers from the London borough of Camden are investigating the theft.Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 and ask for the CID office at Holborn, or the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
