David Cameron today unveiled a three-pronged approach to tackling Britain's poor track record in dealing with rape in a campaign that his party hoped would be popular among women.Speaking to the Conservative Women's Organisation, the Tory leader said that the Conservatives would introduce police reforms that would secure more convictions and introduce longer sentences to send out a strong signal that it was never acceptable to force women to have sex.Cameron announced a review of prisons and sentencing to be led by Nick Herbert, who would look at changes to sentencing on rape convictions."It means doing all we can to help victims, by understanding the harrowing circumstances so they don't feel intimidated when presenting their evidence. And it means making sure the length of sentence is proportionate to the crime."Better victim support was also crucial to increasing conviction rates, he added, but said that unpredictable funding had forced the closure of one third of rape support centres since 1984. He said that the Conservatives would make funding more predictable for rape crisis centres by replacing annual funding decisions with three-year funding cycles."This would give these vitally important public services the certainty and stability they need to help victims of rape."Changing social attitudes was key to Cameron's three-pronged approach. He referred to recent Amnesty International study of young people in the UK which found that one in four thought it was acceptable for a boy to expect to have sex with a girl if she had been very flirtatious.Despite new laws requiring a defendant to prove that he "reasonably" believes that a woman agreed to have sex, Cameron claimed studies now showed that half of young men believed there were circumstances where it was acceptable to force a woman to have sex."In my mind, this is an example of moral collapse," he said, blaming these attitudes on the "growing sexualisation" of society, where "it's cool to treat women like sex objects". Singling out the music industry and the media, he said that both needed to "exercise their responsibility in how they present female role models".In response to the speech, Vernon Coaker, the crime reduction minister, said that the government had taken significant steps to improve rape conviction rates. Measures included extending the network of Sexual Assault Referral Centres, introducing specialist officers and specialist rape prosecutors and providing guidance and training for police, prosecutors and barristers on serious sexual offences. He added that the Home Office was piloting "independent sexual violence advisers" in 38 areas to provide support for victims, and providing funding through the Victims Fund for voluntary organisations supporting victims of sexual violence.Coaker said that these measures were supported by tougher sentences for sexual offences as part of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and new powers to allow police to take DNA samples from those arrested for recordable offences, which since April 2004 had led to the conviction of 90 rapists. Women's groups welcomed Cameron's pledge to tackle low conviction rates and called on the government to embark on a nationwide campaign to change social attitudes and support victims.Heather Harvey of Amnesty International's Stop Violence Against Women campaign praised the Tory leader, saying: "David Cameron is absolutely right to draw attention to the shockingly low conviction rate for rape in this country, especially in terms of challenging public attitudes in this area."Sheila Coates, the policy chair of National Rape Crisis in England and Wales, also endorsed David Cameron's call for more to be done throughout society to tackle the low conviction rate.She agreed with his suggestions for cultural change to stop women being viewed as objects and for children to be taught about sexual consent as a matter of course in sex-education classes."It is important that we talk to children, so that years later when they become jurors, they no longer believe the myths of sexual assault: that women and girls are asking for it if they wear particular clothes, or are out late, or are drinking, that it's all their fault."Coates also appealed to government to fund public awareness campaigns to dispel these myths."We want to see government campaigns such as the ones against smoking and for people to wear seat belts."Katherine Rake, the director of the Fawcett Society, declared that it was a "national disgrace" that there was a lack of investment in services for rape victims when the conviction rate remained so low."Rape crisis centres are at risk of closing all over the country due to a lack of funding, leaving women with nowhere to turn at a time when they desperately need support."She also welcomed Cameron's efforts to move the debate forward by examining public attitudes to rape."This should not be a party-political issue, and we now look to the government to respond in a positive way to these proposals."
