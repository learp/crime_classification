Campaigners for Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager who was murdered in a racist attack five years ago, are urging the BBC's director general to pull the plug on a planned Panorama interview with five suspects.Reporter Martin Bashir, who interviewed Diana, Princess of Wales, and au pair Louise Woodward, has written to the suspects asking them to talk to him on the BBC1 current affairs programme.The Stephen Lawrence Family Campaign says John Birt should not allow it to be broadcast."I am very shocked," said campaign spokesman Suresh Grover. "These boys declined to give full answers at the public inquiry and inquest into Stephen's death. Now they have chosen to use the media to give their version."It smacks of contempt for the inquiry, the inquest and for Stephen's family."He said the plan to have a black journalist interview the five suspects smacked of a publicity stunt which could not be taken seriously."This is an attempt to tell their side of the story and try and get sympathy. John Birt should stop it," he added.The suspects; Jamie Acourt, Neil Acourt, Luke Knight, David Norris and Gary Dobson, contacted publicist Max Clifford for advice several weeks after the public inquiry into Stephen's death ended in July.Mr Clifford said: "They came to me and said the British public believed they were guilty and asked me to represent them, as they said they are innocent."Mr Clifford, who is not representing the suspects, gave them free advice. "I told them the only way to change this was to stand up to public scrutiny, but it would be a rough ride."This will be very much trial by media, but in this case it is totally justified, as nobody believes that justice has been done," he said. "Mr Bashir has written to the five via their solicitors."The men have, in the past, declined numerous requests for interviews with television companies and newspapers.Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death in a racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.Neil Acourt and Gary Dobson and Luke Knight were cleared of murder in April 1996 at the Old Bailey in London. Charges against Jamie Acourt and David Norris, were dropped at the committal stage.A private prosecution by the Lawrence family against the other three failed, but all five men were forced to give evidence at the inquiry into Stephen's death, although their answers were often: "Can't remember".Mr Grover said: "I am shocked that Max Clifford is giving them lessons on answering questions and that Martin Bashir is interviewing them."He said that representatives of the Lawrence family would contact Mr Bashir and ask him to pull out of the programme.A BBC spokesman said: "Yes, we are considering a Panorama programme about this case for the autumn schedule and Martin Bashir will be the reporter."But it is very early days and we don't publicly discuss contributors to programmes before they are made."
