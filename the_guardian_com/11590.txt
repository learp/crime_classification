Police are searching for suspected rustlers who stole six fully grown elks from a farm in Somerset.Officers believe the thieves may have used dogs to round the large beasts up and must have had a sizeable lorry. They are particularly keen to speak to anyone who has been offered cuts of elk meat â€“ or even an actual elk.Fortunately, farmer Paul Richards managed to stop a herd of bison, which roam in the same fields as the elk, from escaping after a fence was cut."If they had got out it could have been a catastrophe," said Paul Richards, who raises elk, bison and wild boar for their meat at Woodentop farm, near West Coker.The animals, which stand taller than a human adult, vanished between Thursday and Friday last week. Another elk was found nearby and returned.PC Jackie Poole, who is leading the hunt, said: "This is an unusual theft and would have required a vehicle, and probably quite a bit of time, to complete. I would ask people in the area at the time to cast their mind back and see if they remember seeing anything suspicious."I am particularly interested in speaking to anyone who has been approached about elks or elk meat or anyone who saw a vehicle in the area which was capable of stealing these animals. It is possible that dogs were used to help herd the animals. If you can help please give me a call."Richards said he believed it was possible that the elk may not have been stolen but could have been freed by animal rights activists or even vandals, adding: "We're still trying to piece together what happened."He said that if the elk were roaming free rather than being taken they did not pose a danger to members of the public, despite their impressive size.
