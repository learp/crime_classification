Domestic violence cases are not being dealt with properly by the probation service, a report claimed today.National targets for dealing with domestic violence cases are being missed and plans on how to manage the risks are poor, according to the Chief Inspector of Probation's team. Only 21% of cases sampled by the inspection team were rated "good" and none were rated "excellent". Only 34% of cases sampled gave sufficient consideration to the safety of the victim. When there were children in the household, the risk of harm to them was only analysed in 59% of cases. Only 27% of cases were re-assessed after another incident took place that caused concern.The report said assessments of the likelihood of further harm were generally sub-standard and discussions on the history of offending were not checked with other sources or previous probation records. The most common reason given for this was a lack of time for proper research.The Chief Inspector of Probation, Andrew Bridges, said: "The findings of this inspection show there is much room for improvement."A local government report, also released this week, has shown that councils are failing to reduce the number of repeat victims of domestic violence. The LGA report described reducing repeat victimisation as the "greatest challenge". The problem is even more serious in cases of women with mental health problems and drug misuse. A Women's Aid report revealed that only a fifth of refuge organisations would accommodate women who had mental health problems if they had space. However, almost 60% of women who have mental health problems experience domestic violence.A report in February found that police fail to record more than half of domestic violence crimes that are reported. There is a domestic violence call to police every minute, and two women are killed every week by their partner.A bill currently before parliament proposes the first overhaul of domestic violence legislation in 30 years.
