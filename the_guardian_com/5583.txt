John Yates, who has become the country's new top counterterrorism officer following Bob Quick's resignation in the wake of an embarrassing security lapse, is no stranger to being pushed centre stage when the Met has a problem on its hands.During 27 years with the Met, he has been in the spotlight over a series of high-profile operations, most notably the tortuous – and ultimately futile – 16-month investigation into the Labour "cash for honours" allegations.A confident and smooth public figure who is well respected within the force, "Yates of the Yard" has also acted increasingly as its public face when difficult apologies are needed.In December, the 50-year-old appeared in front of the cameras to express regret that police had missed a series of chances to catch Robert Napper, the multiple rapist who went on to murder Rachel Nickell.Earlier that year, Yates told the Guardian that police were partly responsible for the "appalling" rape conviction rate by failing to take victims seriously enough.It was also his task to travel to Brazil to meet the parents of Jean Charles de Menezes, the young electrician shot dead in July 2005 at Stockwell underground station in south London by anti-terrorism officers after being mistaken for a would-be suicide bomber.Educated at the private Marlborough college and King's College London, Yates joined the Met in 1981 and spent time in uniform and as a detective, later leading investigations into more than 20 murders.Between 1999 and 2000, he worked as staff officer to the then commissioner, Paul Condon, during the period of the Macpherson inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence.In 2001, as a detective superintendent, Yates led an inquiry into internal police corruption centred on a crime squad based in East Dulwich, south London. The inquiry resulted in the jailing of six serving detectives.As head of the Special Inquiry Squad, also known as the "Celebrity Squad", Yates handled a series of sensitive cases, notably the conviction for perjury of the novelist and former Conservative party chairman Lord Archer, the investigation of the television presenter John Leslie over claims of rape and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? fraud case.In 2002, he also took charge of the trial of the former royal butler Paul Burrell for the alleged theft of possessions belonging to Princess Diana. The case eventually collapsed, following an intervention by the Queen.At the start of 2004, Yates was promoted to deputy assistant commissioner, taking responsibility for homicide, child protection and organised crime, among other duties.From December that year, he ran Operation Bracknell, the Met's response to the Indian ocean tsunami in which more than 160 Britons were killed. His efforts saw him awarded the Queen's Police Medal.Perhaps more difficult still was Yates's stewardship of the investigation into whether Labour figures broke the law by allegedly holding out the prospect of peerages and other honours in return for donations to the party, which would have breached the 1925 Honours Act.The 16-month inquiry ended in July 2007, with no charges brought.Some government figures felt Yates and his officers took an excessively heavy-handed approach at times, with, for example, the 6am arrest of Ruth Turner, a Downing Street aide, and the arrest of Tony Blair's friend and envoy Lord Levy.Yates, however, insisted he had simply been following the evidence and also noted that his officers had at times received "less than full co-operation" from those allegedly involved.A fanatical fan of Liverpool football club – he was born and brought up in the city – Yates is also a keen cyclist who has in the past pedalled full stages of the Tour de France, and is an enthusiastic cook.
