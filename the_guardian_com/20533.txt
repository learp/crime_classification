From what I saw of them, they were very fun-loving, kind and caring â€“ full of life."The woman, who did not want to be named, said: "They were a nice family."Another neighbour, who lives round the corner, said: "It's such a shock. We've been up all night watching what's been going on."This really is a quiet street. You just don't expect it."I didn't know them, apart from seeing them around and about."They had two boys. It's just so sad."
