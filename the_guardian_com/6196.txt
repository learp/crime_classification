The lives of several more people could be under threat following the murder of a Derry man in the city centre last week, a senior police officer has warned.As police on both sides of the Irish border hunt for a republican in connection with the killing of Barry McCrory last Thursday morning, a senior officer in Derry confirmed that a number of other individuals are in danger of suffering the same fate as the murder victim.They are searching for Kieran McLaughlin, a 58-year-old republican who has served a jail sentence for possession of arms.Chief Inspector Jon Burrows of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said: "Clearly there was a gun involved in this murder, so we need to approach this man with caution. Several people may also be in danger."He's innocent until proven guilty, but releasing his photo and name reflects the concerns we have."He added: "There have certainly been sightings of Kieran in Donegal and in Derry. We have alerted airports and our colleagues across the water."This isn't going away. This is causing fear in the community and we need details now."A local member of the Northern Ireland Assembly issued an appeal for McLaughlin to give himself up.The SDLP's Pat Ramsey, who lives in Derry's Bogside, said: "I have spoken to the McLaughlin family who are clearly very distressed about the current whereabouts of Kieran."Kieran McLaughlin is in a dark place and his family are in a darker place."I want to urge Kieran to contact the PSNI so that he can give an account of his movements."We all want to see a swift and safe end to the tragic events of last week."Barry McCrory was shot dead inside his apartment in Derry's Shipquay Street last Thursday morning. His partner was in the flat when he was murdered.
