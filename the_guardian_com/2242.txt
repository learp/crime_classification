A senior Home Office civil servant has launched a philosophical dissection of Tony Blair's "tough on crime" soundbite.Paul Wiles, now director of research, development and statistics at the Home Office, has labelled New Labour's mantra as cruel, dishonest and confused in a book published yesterday, Crime, Disorder and Community Safety.Mr Blair first coined the "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime" phrase in 1993 when he was shadow home secretary and has repeated it during the current campaign. Persistent juvenile offenders must be locked up, he said, but society must also ask itself how it had created a generation capable of committing such crimes. The phrase strengthened Labour's claim to be a party of law and order. But Mr Wiles questions Labour's evidence for claiming a direct relationship between inequality and criminal activity and argues that the soundbite is contradictory."If being tough on crime means being tough on the criminal, one is tough on offenders even though distributive unfairness led to their offending," he says. "If one is tough on the causes of crime, it becomes unnecessary to be tough on offenders. If people offend because of their exposure to the causes of crime, it is unfair to be tough on them."The paper was written before his appointment to the Home Office by the home secretary, Jack Straw. He was formerly professor of criminology at the University of Sheffield.Interactive guideElection countdown: the key dates up to June 7Related articles01.06.2001: Labour attacks 'dictatorship' claims01.06.2001: Hague promises boost for regeneration 01.06.2001: Tories' cracks begin to show01.06.2001: Interview with Gordon Brown01.06.2001: A net election no-show Comment and analysis01.06.2001: James Fenton on the campaign trail with William Hague01.06.2001, Hugo Young: We too have twisted the truth01.06.2001, Polly Toynbee: Snooker the ToriesInteractive quizzesCan you be bothered?Election?
