Detectives investigating the murder of French student Amélie Delagrange issued new images today of a "crucial" van believed to have been used by her killer.The fresh pictures and CCTV of the Ford Courier van were released by Scotland Yard officers as part of a new appeal a year on from Ms Delagrange's brutal murder. Police also announced details of a £20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the van, which is likely to prove key to catching her killer.Ms Delagrange, 22, was found battered to death near the cricket pitch on Twickenham Green, south west London, one year ago tomorrow, after a night out in the Cristalz wine bar in nearby London Road. She died of severe head injuries.Her murder has been linked with five other attacks in the area, including the killing of 19-year-old gap-year student Marsha McDonnell in nearby Hampton and the attempted murder of the 18-year-old Kate Sheedy.It also emerged earlier this year that Surrey police were examining links between Ms Delagrange's murder and the hunt for the killer of 13-year-old Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler. A few days after Ms Delagrange was killed, some of her belongings were found dumped in the river Thames at Walton-on-Thames near where Milly lived.Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, who is leading the investigation, said today: "We still haven't found the white Ford Courier van, registration P610 XCN, which we believe was used by Amelie's killer."We believe the vehicle was used by the suspect on August 19 last year and he was in possession of that vehicle before that date. The vehicle was registered to Cargo Air Services, Stanwell, Heathrow. They sold the vehicle on and it could currently be in the lawful and legitimate possession of a member of the public."The photos of the van released today were taken in April and May last year in Hillingdon. The van has metal chequered plates across the bottom of the rear doors and a black plinth on the roof."Locating it is of such vital importance to us that we have taken the unusual step of linking its recovery to the offer of a substantial reward for information leading to a prosecution," Mr Sutton said. "There is still also a small group of people who were nearby that night that we have yet to identify. We have no suspicion that any of these people were involved in the murder, but it is possible that they still have small pieces of information which could be of enormous help to us."Mr Sutton added: "We have made tremendous progress in this investigation, and I am still absolutely confident that Am&eacutelie's murderer will be brought to justice."One of the images, taken by a parking warden while issuing tickets in Hillingdon, showed the van some three months before Ms Delagrange's murder. Another, recorded by a CCTV camera in Hampton Road, showed the van heading away from Twickenham Green a few minutes before she was found there, dying.A third, recorded by a CCTV camera in Church Street, Hampton, showed the van heading south, soon after Ms Delagrange was discovered. Clearly visible are the missing front left wheel trim and the black plinth on the roof.The hunt for the killer, codenamed Operation Yeaddiss, is being linked to six other attacks in south west London.In addition to the link to the murder of Ms McDonnell and the attempted murder of Ms Sheedy, it is also being linked to an attack on 36-year-old accounts clerk Dawn Brunton.Ms Brunton was hit from behind - possibly with a sledgehammer - in Hatton Road, Feltham, west London, on November 5 2003. Another linked case is the attempted murder and robbery of Sonia Salvatierra, 26, who was assaulted in Twickenham in November 2002.The team is also investigating an assault in Longford, in which a 33-year-old hairdresser was attacked as she waited at a bus stop in Bath Road.Earlier this month, Scotland Yard's assistant commissioner, Tarique Ghaffur, revealed that work on several major murder inquiries in London - including the hunt for Ms Delagrange's killer - had slowed almost to a "trickle" since last month's bomb attacks on the capital because of the pressure on police resources.
