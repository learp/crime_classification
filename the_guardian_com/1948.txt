She was left for dead, the pregnant victim of an horrific knife attack that shocked the nation. Paralysed from the neck down, Abigail Witchalls' life story seemed destined to become synonymous with tragedy. But yesterday photographs of Abigail, 26, proudly clutching her new baby, paid testament to the remarkable inner strength she has displayed since the attack seven months ago.Abigail's husband, Benoit, and their two-year-old son, Joseph, were photographed at her bedside hours after she overcame medical fears to give birth on Friday to a 5lb 6oz boy, premature at 35 weeks, but healthy. Contrary to reports, she did not need a Caesarean section and has started breastfeeding.Abigail was in the early stages of pregnancy last April when she was stabbed in the neck while pushing Joseph in his buggy near her home in Little Bookham, Surrey. She was not expected to survive and was given the last rites in hospital.She said: 'I've found great strength and comfort in carrying this child over the past few months and it is such a blessing and a joy to finally see him face to face.'Abigail and her husband said in a statement they were 'delighted' to announce the arrival of their second son, who has yet to be named. They added: 'Joseph said after seeing the baby for the first time, "Baby come out!" He is looking forward to playing with his brother.'Abigail will be at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, for several days before returning to her specially adapted home.Surrey police have passed a file containing details of their investigation into the attack to the Crown Prosecution Service. Richard Cazaly, 23, has been a suspect in the case since his apparent suicide from an overdose in Scotland within days of the attack.
