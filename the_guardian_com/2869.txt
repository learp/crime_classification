The mother of Moors murder victim Keith Bennett spoke today of her shock at receiving a letter from her son's notorious killer Ian Brady.Winnie Johnson, 72, talked of her surprise at receiving the two-page letter from Brady, who is detained at the high-security Ashworth hospital near Liverpool.Twelve-year-old Keith was murdered by Brady and his girlfriend Myra Hindley in 1964 and is presumed buried on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester.Brady wrote in the letter - dated December 21 2005 and addressed to "Dear Mrs Bennett" - that he was being kept alive by force-feeding for "political purposes", according to today's Sun. Mrs Johnson, 72, from Manchester, has pleaded for Brady, 68, to reveal where Keith was buried but said the letter came as a complete surprise."It was a shock to me. He knows a lot more than what he is saying," she told Sky News. "He's admitted he can take police to within 20 yards of where he buried Keith, so that man's not insane, and they just ignored him."Why should they ignore a thing like that? It's a human life that's gone 41 years ago, and I have had hell since he's been gone."Despite several police searches of the Moor, no trace of Keith's remains have ever been uncovered. The bodies of the killers' other child victims have been found.In the letter Brady claimed he was "perfectly rational" but said his previous offers to help find Keith's body were "ignored by authorities".Brady did not refer directly to Keith by name and does not claim he can take investigators directly to the grave but he does insist on the "clarity" of his recollections.The prisoner is understood to have ignored previous written appeals by Mrs Johnson to help find the body of her son. Brady and Hindley began their killing spree on July 12 1963. They were both jailed for life in 1966.
