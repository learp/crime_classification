Police were treating the inside of a transatlantic flight diverted to Heathrow as a crime scene last night after a male passenger became ill and died.The KLM flight, a Boeing 777 that was bound for Amsterdam from the Peruvian capital, Lima, was diverted after what police described as a medical emergency on board.The plane landed at Heathrow shortly after 2.15pm, where it was met by paramedics, and a male passenger, who is believed to have been in his 30s or 40s, was pronounced dead at the scene.John Hopwood, a nurse from Manchester who was returning after a holiday in South America, said he and other passengers were kept on board the aircraft for five hours before they were told that it was going to be treated as a crime scene and that they would have to disembark. "There was no commotion on board. We were just told initially that someone had taken ill," he said.After passengers were addressed by a senior police officer in one of Heathrow's terminals, he said that they had been told by police that the death was being treated as "suspicious"."[The police officer] said they were bringing a forensics team over from the other side of London," added Hopwood, who said that he was sitting about six seats behind the passenger, in the economy section of the plane."We did ask why it took so long for it to be designated as a crime scene. We were kept on the plane for five hours and during that time people would have been walking past the seat where the passenger was.""People are confused about why it took so long. There are a lot of Latin American people who still have not reached the end of very long journeys, and who were unhappy because there was no one to properly translate what was going on."A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police confirmed that inquiries were under way into the circumstances of the death, which was being treated as unexplained. A spokesperson for KLM said the airline had no comment to make.
