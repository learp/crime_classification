A girl who alleges she was raped by members of a gang who groomed children for sex had begged care workers to move her because she "wanted it to stop", a court has been told.The teenager claimed she was violently raped and sexually abused on a number of occasions after she had been placed in a care home in Rochdale in 2009.Liverpool crown court heard on Friday that the girl repeatedly asked workers at the care home where she was staying to send her away from Rochdale but her requests fell on deaf ears.She first wrote a note to staff at the home on 24 February 2010, the jury was told.During a video interview played to the court, the girl told police she had wanted to move for a long time. She said: "I had been asking for a move since January and they were saying they were not going to move me. I had wanted to move for ages and ages."Asked why she had wanted to switch to another home, the girl told the officer: "Asians were picking me up and they have sex with me and give me money not to say anything."The court heard that she wrote a second note on 16 March 2010, throwing it down the stairs at a member of staff.When questioned about the second written request, the girl told her interviewer: "I had been asking for a move for ages because I wanted it to stop, going out, getting drunk, smoking weed and then people doing stuff to me. It's not good, is it?"The girl was finally moved out of the area the following month.The court has heard that large groups of men, some of them taxi drivers or workers in takeaway food outlets, are said to have targeted vulnerable girls aged 13 to 15 who were groomed and sexually exploited in locations across north-west England.The victims were encouraged to exchange sex for alcohol, cash and pizzas, jurors were told, and those who resisted were intimidated or attacked. All but one of the offences are alleged to have taken place between 2008 and 2010.The teenager told the court how she was raped violently by two men at a house in Rochdale. She said a man she knew as Shah grabbed her hair and slapped her before raping her. Moments later, she said, a man she knew as Hamid attacked her, saying: "I want a turn."The girl described another occasion when Shah, Hamid and a third man took it in turns to rape her while she was being sick after drinking alcohol.Eleven men, aged from 21 to 59, deny numerous child sex offences. The men, from Oldham and Rochdale, are each charged with conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child. They are Kabeer Hassan, 24, Abdul Aziz, 41, Abdul Rauf, 43, Mohammed Sajid, 35, Adil Khan, 42, Abdul Qayyum, 43, Mohammed Amin, 44, Qamar Shahzad, 29, Liaquat Shah, 41, and Hamid Safi, 22, and a 59-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons.The case continues.
