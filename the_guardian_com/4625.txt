Claims that a member of the royal family took part in a sex act with another man at a party are not true, the trial of his alleged blackmailers was told today.On first being told of the assertion, an aide to the royal told the Old Bailey that she "knew it was not true".Another witness giving evidence, a close friend of the alleged victim, said he was quite clear about the motives of those making the claim."It is extortion," he said. "It is quite simple - moving mud about whether true or not."It always sticks, and against the fear it sticks you get people to do something or refrain from doing something."To avoid identifying the royal involved – referred to throughout the case only as A – both the aide and friend gave evidence behind a screen and were named only as B and C respectively.Ian Strachan and Sean McGuigan are alleged to have attempted to blackmail the royal by demanding £50,000 for the handing over of the audio and video recordings in which one of his former employees makes a series of lurid allegations about him.Chief among the allegations, the jury was told, is a claim that the royal performed oral sex on the male former employee at a party after being encouraged by a stripper from Stringfellows nightclub.Other allegations in the tapes include that the royal took drugs and was improper in his business dealings.Strachan, 31, and 41-year-old McGuigan, both from London, deny the charge of "an unwarranted demand with menaces" for £50,000.The court has heard that after unsuccessfully trying to hawk the allegations to a series of tabloid newspapers, the pair telephoned the royal aide, B, to discuss the contents of the tapes."I was somewhat stunned, I have to say," B told the jury today. "I just said that was interesting. I knew it was not true."After other calls, B said, she contacted a close friend of the royal, C, who is a lawyer. Describing the claims made about the royal as "definitely not true", C described talking at some length with McGuigan and hearing the assertions.Recounting what McGuigan said to him, C told the court: "When you mention on the tape a blow job it is very bad, whichever way you want to see it."After hearing from McGuigan that the pair did not want money, C told the defendants to drop the tapes off at the royal's London office so they could be destroyed. However, he said he was then called by Strachan, who demanded £50,000.C contacted the police and, despite being "very nervous", helped set up an operation in which the defendants met a man they believed was a royal aide but was in fact an undercover policeman.McGuigan and Strachan were arrested at the meeting in September last year at the Hilton hotel in Park Lane, central London.The trial continues.
