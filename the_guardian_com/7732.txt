The glamorous lifestyles of 12 previously "untouchable" criminals have been targeted by a new agency hoping to seize tens of millions of pounds from them through the civil courts, investigators revealed yesterday.Files on the criminals have been passed to the assets recovery agency (ARA), whose powers came into force yesterday under the Proceeds of Crime Act.The ARA has powers to seize valuables and cash if there are "reasonable grounds" to believe they have come from criminal activity; the onus will be on the suspect to prove that the assets, such as homes, cars and yachts, were paid for with legitimately earned money. The agency will intervene if there is no prospect of a prosecution or when the suspect has already been convicted. "We have received an initial batch of 12 cases," said Jane Earl, the agency's director. "They are a real mix of well-known names, as well as some smaller operators." Cases are handed to the agency from a number of sources including customs, the national crime squad and the national criminal intelligence service. The home secretary, David Blunkett, said it would target criminal "parasites" with "flashy" lifestyles and no visible legitimate income, and he hoped it would recover up to Â£60m by the end of the 2004-05 financial year. He added: "We are hitting organised criminals where it really hurts, in their pockets."
