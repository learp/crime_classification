A man has been jailed for eight years after shaking and killing his partner's child in a fit of temper.Craig Lewis, 32, had already admitted manslaughter and inflicting grievous bodily harm on 22-month-old Kieron Barley, causing him catastrophic brain injuries, at the family home in 2011.Sentencing Lewis on Friday at Birmingham crown court, Judge William Davis QC told him: "I am asked to consider you are now remorseful and contrite, but I have difficulty in accepting that proposition."Indeed, the report compiled by the very experienced probation officer states: 'The defendant's explanation for his conduct was underlying stresses coming to a head – in my view, Mr Lewis does not fully explain his behaviour for both offences.'The trigger appears to have been relatively minor and he reacted with considerable violence towards a young and vulnerable child."The toddler's 26-year-old mother, Louise Barley, of Denshaw Road in Kings Heath, Birmingham, who had previously admitted child cruelty, was jailed for 15 months at the same hearing.Andrew Lockhart QC, in mitigation for Lewis, said his client had cocaine and alcohol problems, which he had struggled to deal with. He said Lewis was "struggling to deal with life".It was against this background, Lockhart added, that Lewis twice attacked the boy, including the incident in June in which there was "a fateful shake, a fateful throw – and it was all over".  Character references stated Lewis was "a good father" until what his barrister described as "these dreadful lapses". Lockhart asked the judge to give his client credit for his guilty pleas.Kristina Montgomery QC, for Barley, said her client had "poor self-esteem" and had acted out of loyalty to Lewis, in the "genuine belief" he had nothing to do with the attacks.She added that it was only shortly before Lewis's admissions earlier this year that Barley found out the truth about what had happened to her son."She accepts that she did not do everything she could or should have done to alleviate what happened on 28 May," said Montgomery.She added: "She has been punished – she is genuinely remorseful. She feels responsibility and guilt, and she will find the remainder of her life difficult."
