Defendants who wish to receive reduced sentences by pleading guilty must do so at an earlier stage in the criminal justice process, the Sentencing Council is proposing under draft guidelines.Those who admit they committed a crime can benefit from up to a third off the sentence they would receive at the end of a contested trial. Under the new regulations, it is suggested the stage at which an offender can benefit from the maximum reduction will be more tightly defined.Under the council’s proposals to be released on Thursday, to qualify for the maximum reduction an offender would have to acknowledge their guilt the first time they are asked for their plea in court.For those who plead guilty after that first stage, the maximum reduction for which they are eligible will be one-fifth, compared to one-quarter under the current process. Reductions then drop further the closer to the trial date the plea is entered.The stricter system is intended to persuade more defendants to plead guilty earlier in the court process than they do currently. Many defendants currently delay their plea for as long as possible until they can see the strength of the prosecution evidence.Sentencing Council chair Lord Justice Treacy said: “We want those who have committed crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible. When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that they are spared having to appear at court to testify. “It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other cases.“We want to develop a guideline that is clear, fair and consistent, so this consultation is open to everyone including members of the judiciary, legal practitioners and any individuals who work in or have an interest in criminal justice.” Lucy Hastings, director at independent charity Victim Support, said: “Our charity knows how traumatic it can be to give evidence in court, so we support these proposals which encourage offenders to plead guilty earlier and spare their victims and witnesses an unnecessary ordeal in court. “However, it is critical that this process is properly explained to victims and that their right to describe, through a victim personal statement, the impact of the crime they suffered is recognised and respected by police, prosecutors and the courts.“The impact of any new guidelines should also be closely monitored, to ensure that earlier guilty pleas are indeed resulting in more victims and witnesses knowing at an earlier stage that they will not have to go through the potential trauma of a court appearance.”
