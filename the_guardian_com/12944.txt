The attacks on the Romanians in Belfast are a reminder that hate crime in Northern Ireland extends well beyond the sectarian dispute between Protestants and Catholics. According to the latest figures from the police service of Northern Ireland, racially motivated crime is on the increase while sectarian crime has held steady. Last year the number of racially motivated incidents rose to 990, up from 41 in 1996, when statistics were first gathered. Today 40% of racist incidents involve violent crime, while the rest are against property. At the time of the most recent census, in 2001, the largest immigrant groups were Chinese (4,100), south Asians (2,500), Irish Travellers (1,700) and Afro-Caribbeans (1,100). Since then there have been influxes from eastern European countries including Poland.In April groups of Hungarians, Lithuanians, Slovakians and Poles said intimidation forced them out of the Village, an area of south Belfast where many immigrants have tried to settle. The incident followed a football match between Northern Ireland and Poland at which there had been trouble between the groups of fans.Northern Ireland's well-established Chinese population has often been a target of racist attacks. When Anna Lo, a Chinese woman who had lived in Northern Ireland for 32 years, stood for election to the Northern Ireland assembly in 2007, she had to carry a panic alarm because of the racist abuse she suffered. A far-right website published pornographic images of Chinese women linked to abusive remarks about her and she said she had been kicked in the street.Neil Jarman from the Institute for Conflict Research in Belfast, who has conducted several studies into racism in Northern Ireland, told the BBC that one legacy of the area's long history of sectarianism has been the creation of a sub-culture where "anyone slightly different becomes a target for intimidation".The authorities are struggling to solve racial crimes and clear-up rates are low for hate crimes, with only one in eight racially motivated offences being prosecuted.
