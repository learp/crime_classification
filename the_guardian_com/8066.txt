Plans to purchase 10,000 Tasers for frontline police across England and Wales are expected to be announced today. The weapons had previously been restricted to use by specialist firearms officers but the government envisages 30,000 officers being trained to handle the stun guns.The company that makes them insists they are safe if used properly. In the US, where civilians can legally use them in most states, special designs for women and even versions including MP3 players are available.The late chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Michael Todd, once volunteered to be Tasered to prove their safety. But there are other cases that are more chilling â€“ most notorious is the death of a Polish man at an airport in Canada after being Tasered.Amnesty International claims 320 people have died after being Tasered since 2001 in the US alone. It does not want a complete ban on their use by police, but believes they should only be used by specialist, highly trained officers and only in dangerous situations.The British home secretary, Jacqui Smith, has suggested Tasers are a lesser evil than arming police, saying she is "proud that we have one of the few police services around the world that do not regularly carry firearms and I want to keep it that way".But the Amnesty International director Katie Allen says "the wider deployment of Tasers could be the start of a slippery slope towards arming all UK police officers".Do you agree it is a dangerous precedent? Or is Smith right to say officers need Tasers to fight crime?
