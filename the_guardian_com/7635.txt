How David Cameron must crave the trappings of high office: a country to run, global leaders for friends and a railing for his bike outside Downing Street that is under 24-hour police guard.The Conservative leader's favoured mode of transport, a silver and black Scott bicycle he has described as "priceless" and "an old friend", was today stolen for the second time in 10 months, this time from railings outside his house in west London.To have his bike nicked once was considered careless and not merely unfortunate because Cameron insecurely chained his machine to a three-foot bollard when he popped into a Tesco in Notting Hill last July.Miraculously, days later, the Tory leader got back his helmet and his bike, minus its front wheel, after Ernest ­Theophile, a Labour-supporting businessman, used his local contacts to retrieve it.Showing admirable faith in humanity – or a worrying failure to learn from his mistakes – this time Cameron did something few London cyclists would risk and chained his bike to railings on the street outside his home. He saw it at 7.10am but an hour later it had vanished from his leafy neighbourhood.Cameron insists on limbering up for prime minister's questions by cycling to Westminster and his parliamentary aide, Desmond Swayne, sacrificed his bike for his leader. "His need was greater; the party would have expected nothing less," said Swayne.Cameron's bike has been a symbol of his eco-friendly credentials but it has also brought trouble. He was criticised last year when photographed riding the wrong way down a one-way street and his green image was tarnished when it was revealed his chauffeur-driven car followed him into work carrying his briefcase and shoes, a perk he quickly stopped.
