One man was yesterday cleared at the Old Bailey of the murder of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death with a broken beer bottle in Peckham, south London, in 2000.The jury, which has been deliberating for five days, was yesterday sent home and will resume their fifth day of discussions this morning.Hassan Jihad, 20, from Peckham, was acquitted unanimously of the murder, manslaughter and assault of Damilola. He left the court with his legal team following the jury's decision. He made no comment.Mr Justice Leveson later sent the 11 jurors home after they had failed to reach a verdict in the case of two brothers, aged 17 and 18, who cannot be named for legal reasons.He told the jurors that he was prepared to accept a majority of 10-1 in the remaining verdicts. All three defendants had pleaded not guilty to all charges.Damilola, who was originally from Nigeria, had only been in Britain for three months when he was killed. He was attacked after he had been working on the computers at Peckham library and collapsed in the stairwell of a nearby block of flats on the North Peckham estate. He was found by a man who followed a trail of blood to the stairwell where Damilola lay dying.In a previous trial, in 2002, four youths were acquitted. A reinvestigation of the case led to the current trial, the jury has heard.The boy's parents, Richard and Gloria Taylor, were in court yesterday.
