Police today released CCTV pictures showing the last moments of a British backpacker before she was murdered in a "ghastly" attack in New Zealand.Karen Aim, 26, was found lying injured in the street in the North Island town of Taupo in the early hours of yesterday morning.New Zealand police said a post-mortem examination confirmed she died of "serious head injuries".The CCTV images show Aim at a BP garage at around 2am shortly after leaving a bar and only half an hour before she was found injured in the street by police.Police revealed that when officers arrived at the scene, she was still conscious and managed to give her name. But the traveller, from Orkney, who arrived in October and had been working in a glass-blowing gallery, died in hospital.There was no indication of any sexual motive, detectives said, but her denim skirt had been disturbed.It was her second visit to New Zealand after a three-month stay in 2006.Police said Aim had visited a number of bars in Taupo on Wednesday night prior to the attack.A team of 50 staff has been drafted in to work on the case, which police have described as a "massive whodunnit".Detective senior sergeant, Greg Turner, said he had spoken to her family in Orkney and to relatives in New Zealand, and they were "devastated".There are as yet no suspects, but the investigation is focusing on a group who vandalised a nearby college at around the time Aim was assaulted.Six windows were smashed at the Taupo Nui-A-Tia college and police are urging members of the group to come forward."The longer those people are at large, the more suspicious it looks for those involved," Turner said."We would ask again for those people to make contact with us."As well as canvassing bars in the area, police will also question taxi companies, as they believe she took a taxi after leaving a bar."We do know that there were two taxis in the area where Karen was found and, as well as a canvass of the bars, we will be canvassing taxi companies," Turner said.He added that he was "confident of a successful resolution".Mystery also surrounds the murder weapon, which the post-mortem failed to identify. Residents living near the scene of the attack are being asked to search their houses and gardens in case a weapon or clothes have been dumped.A blessing ceremony was due to be held at the crime scene.A memorial is planned for next week, with Aim's aunt travelling from Manawatu, in the island's south, for the church service.Dozens of tributes were posted on the social networking website Bebo.Taupo, in the centre of North Island and on the shores of the country's largest lake, is a popular destination for backpackers.It is known for its panoramic views and activities ranging from fishing and boating to skydiving, paragliding and bungee jumping. It is also the venue for a major car race this weekend.Turner said: "We're particularly aware of the fluctuation of tourists into the area but need to speak to anyone who may think they have something to add from their time in Taupo no matter where they are now."
