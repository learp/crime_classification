A young mother was cleared today of murdering her 15-month-old son by poisoning him with salt.A jury found Marianne Williams, 24, of Wiltshire, not guilty of both the murder and manslaughter of Joshua Taylor after a six-week trial at Winchester Crown Court.She was cleared of giving her seriously-ill son, who was born prematurely with failing kidneys, excessive amounts of sodium, leading to his death on February 27 2004.During the trial, the prosecution alleged that Ms Williams, who was on antidepressants, killed her son because she felt she could not cope with caring for him.She had seen the consequences of too much sodium in his system earlier in February, when the child was taken to hospital suffering from high salt levels, the court was told.The defence said Joshua died as a result of a combination of his medical condition and the drugs he was taking for his care. Joshua was taken to Southampton general hospital, Hants, on February 24 in a serious condition, the court was told.Tests found very high levels of sodium in his body and despite the efforts of doctors to save him, Joshua died three days later.Ms Williams, originally from Wales, was 21 when Joshua died and in a long-term relationship with his father, Paul Taylor.Joshua was born 12 weeks prematurely by Caesarean on November 26 2002. A twin had died in the womb.The trial heard that because Joshua's kidneys were failing, they would expel too much sodium.He was given daily dosages of sodium chloride to replenish his salt levels, which was necessary for a "healthy existence" and "healthy growth".Ms Williams stood trembling in the dock as the verdict was read out and wiped away tears when she heard that she had been cleared of both charges. The verdict was received with cheers by the her supporters in the public gallery.Outside court, Ms Williams, shaking with joy, said: "I'm just overwhelmed. It has been a long time coming."The jury of six women and six men took two-and-a-half hours to reach their verdicts.DI Matt Johnson, of Wiltshire Police, said outside the court: "The investigation carried out by Wiltshire Police into the sudden death of Joshua Taylor was complex and required sensitivity, thoroughness and, of necessity, detailed liaison with not only medical experts but a number of other agencies including social services."The decision to bring charges was only taken after lengthy consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service and a meticulous review of all the evidence that was available."I'm grateful for the work and commitment of the CPS and I would also like to pay tribute to the police officers and support staff who worked tirelessly with dedication and great professionalism from the outset of what was a very distressing investigation."I acknowledge the verdict reached by the jury and would add only that I am satisfied that every possible piece of evidence that could be found was properly presented to the jury in this case." Speaking outside court, Ms Williams, her mascara running with tears, said: "I keep having floods of relief going through me. I can't concentrate or even think about what has happened."Her legal representative, Jacqui Cameron, said: "Marianne is naturally delighted with the verdict and extremely pleased that common sense has prevailed."We, as lawyers, however, are very concerned that the parents, usually mothers, are continuing to face the grave charge of murder in what can only be described, at best, as complex and, at worst, dubious evidence. "Clinicians are far too prone to point fingers of suspicion at persons who are already vulnerable."The verdict today gives us hope that the general public is learning the lessons that doctors are failing to learn despite other high level cases such as Sally Clark, Trupti Patel and Angela Cannings."These allegations when made have devastating effects on families and should never be made unless there has been a full independent investigation of the facts."The jury in this case have undertaken the task of investigating the facts and Marianne wishes to thank them for the care and attention they have taken."But by the time these matters come before the jury, irreparable damage has already been caused."Today's verdict means Marianne can go home to her family and begin to rebuild her life."She would like to take this heartfelt opportunity to thank her legal team."Marianne would like to give special thanks to her mother and the rest of her family and friends who have supported her throughout her ordeal and without whom she could not have gone on two years and eight months and remain strong."
