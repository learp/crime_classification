The parents of a three-year-old girl who was abducted and indecently assaulted by a convicted paedophile said there were "still questions unanswered" after meeting the attorney general today. Following two-and-a-half hours of talks with Lord Goldsmith at Westminster, the family of Craig Sweeney's victim said he had "listened" and been "constructive" but there were still matters that needed to be addressed.Anne Tyson, the family's lawyer, said: "It seems to have been a constructive meeting. The family had a chance to put across their views, and the politicians were very sympathetic. But there weren't that many hard answers. We just hope the lessons can be learned and the changes can be put in place."The meeting, which was also attended by the Home Office minister, Baroness Scotland, came after the family yesterday announced plans to bring a civil action against South Wales police.They claim the force could have prevented the attack had they reacted differently when the alarm was raised.Sweeney abducted his victim from her Cardiff home in January and repeatedly sexually assaulted her.The Independent Police Complaints Commission yesterday partially upheld a complaint made by the father of Sweeney's victim about the speed of police actions.The watchdog found the force could have prevented part of her ordeal that took place after Sweeney left his home in Newport to cross the Severn Bridge.Sources at Lord Goldsmith's office said the discussions today had been "full and honest".The attorney general is understood to have told the family that things have changed as a result of their daughter's ordeal.The home secretary, John Reid, announced a raft of measures last Thursday to change sentencing guidelines and give judges more powers to lock up dangerous offenders.Sweeney, 24, was jailed for life at Cardiff crown court last month, but told he could apply for parole in five years and 108 days.The sentence was widely criticised as too lenient and calls were made for it to be referred to the court of appeal.But Lord Goldsmith subsequently ruled out such a challenge earlier this month in a decision described as "gut-wrenchingly sick" by the child's mother.Sweeney had been living in Newport at the time of the attack after his early release from jail for indecently assaulting a six-year-old.
