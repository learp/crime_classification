Victims of crime are to be consulted on the conditions of release for the 200 to 300 violent and sexual criminals who leave jail each month.The statutory duty, to ask victims or their families if they want a say in the release of paedophiles and other sex offenders, came into force yesterday, alongside the launch of the national probation service. Paul Boateng, the Home Office minister, said there would be a "law enforcement" emphasis in the national probation service, which replaces the old structure based on 54 localities. There will also be a Â£500m expansion in resources with staff increased by 4,500 beyond the existing 16,000 total. The probation service hopes to recruit an extra 3,000 staff, including former teachers and psychologists, within the next 12 months alone. Eithne Wallis, director of the national probation service, said yesterday she was determined to see probation shed its "soft option" tag, with targets to reduce reconviction rates by 5% for the 200,000 offenders under its supervision. Additionally, there will be "multi-agency public protection panels" involving the police, probation and clinical psychologists, who will assess risk and decide how paedophiles and other dangerous offenders are released into the community. The panels will also include representatives from the local health and education services. Ms Wallis said it would not mean parents having the right to know if a sex offender moves to their area, but people would be informed about any measures taken - though not necessarily offenders' addresses. The probation service also plans to expand places on sex offender treatment programmes outside jail. So far, only about 500 known sex offenders in the community take part in the courses. The aim is to involve all 4,000 known sex offenders outside jail within two years. All those serious offenders serving a prison sentence of more than 12 months will fall under the scheme to consult the victims over their release.
