Ruth Ellis, the last woman in Britain to be hanged, was in a frenzy on the night she shot her lover dead, according to new evidence heard yesterday at the court of appeal.Michael Mansfield QC, appearing for Ellis's sister, Muriel Jakubait, 81, appealed for Ellis's murder conviction to be replaced with manslaughter, arguing that she was provoked and lost control. Ellis was hanged in 1955 after a jury took 14 minutes to convict her of murdering the racing driver, David Blakely, outside a pub in Hampstead, north London. Mr Mansfield produced new evidence from a witness, a retired midwife now living in Australia, who gave a written statement to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 1999. Moreen Gleeson, then in her 20s, came across Ellis in a Hampstead street, allegedly on the night she shot Blakely. Ellis was "stressed and weeping" outside a garden wall. She told Ms Gleeson: "It's my boyfriend. He's in there with another woman. He won't let me in!" Ellis was"quite distraught". To calm her, Ms Gleeson suggested taking her home for a coffee. She said: "Ruth was crying again and said, as if surprised, "Oh! I've got a gun!" Ms Gleeson said a bulky man with a "proprietary air" loomed up and stood "possessively" over Ellis. This was understood to be Desmond Cussen, who, according to Home Office documents that emerged after the trial, had given Ellis a loaded gun and driven her to the scene. Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Mr Justice Silber and Mr Justice Leveson, said it was highly unusual that Ellis did not appeal against her sentence. Mr Mansfield said she had no desire to appeal. He added that when she killed Blakely, she intended to kill herself too, but had used up her ammunition. The appeal judges declined to hear fresh evidence from a medical expert, which Mr Mansfield said would show Ellis was suffering from "battered woman syndrome" at the time of the shooting. Lord Justice Kay said the evidence was not admissable in law. Judgment was reserved .
