Thousands of bureau de change outlets throughout Britain will be subject to tough new regulations to prevent them being used for money laundering if Labour wins the general election, the home secretary, Jack Straw, announced yesterday.Under a new crime bill designed to confiscate criminal assets, bureau de change operators will be forced to register their owners' details and sign up to a new code of practice amid evidence that hundreds of millions of pounds are laundered through the unlicensed outlets every year. Mr Straw ordered the crackdown after research found that one outlet was used to launder £70m of criminal proceeds between 1994 and 1996. "The UK is the only EU country which does not regulate bureaux de change or money transmission agents," a Labour briefing document on the new crime bill said. "As a result, there is good evidence that some of them have become significantly involved in money laundering for organised criminals."Any bureau de change outlet which refuses to comply with the new register or the code of practice will face fines or closure. Labour believes that the scheme will be highly successful because two-thirds of bureaux de change in the Netherlands closed after a similar scheme was introduced. A new criminal assets agency will also be set up in an attempt to double the amount of assets seized from criminals by giving police and customs officers new powers to seize money or property from criminals before they are convicted. Half the money seized would go back into frontline policing and crime fighting in local communities. It is estimated that up to £650m a year is generated through criminal activity in Britain. Only £44m of that was seized last year. Mr Straw said yesterday: "For too long, organised drugs criminals have been able to evade the law and profit from the misery of others. Their lavish lifestyles are an insult to victims and weaken confidence in our criminal justice system. And their activities fuel local crime waves and tear communities apart. "It is estimated that just one kilo of heroin distributed at street level can generate 220 victims of burglary and £220,000 worth of property stolen by addicts to fuel their habits. That is not acceptable, and we have been developing detailed proposals in government to help the police and the courts target these people, and their assets." Under the new bill, police and customs officers would be able to seize assets if they had "reasonable grounds" to suspect that they were the proceeds of crime or intended for use in a crime. Mr Straw added: "New legislation will be brought forward as soon as possible to make it easier for our justice system to bring organised criminals to justice - and to ensure that they cannot profit from their evil activities. "Crime has come down since 1997, and new figures suggest recorded crime fell by a further 3% over the last year."Interactive guideElection countdown: the key dates up to June 7Interactive quizzesCan you be bothered?Election?
