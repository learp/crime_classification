Two police officers accused of gross misconduct following the fatal stabbing of a young mother by her ex-partner are to face a public disciplinary hearing.It is the first time the Independent Police Complaints Commission has used its powers to allow the public into misconduct proceedings, usually held in private. The move follows an IPCC investigation last year which concluded that Colette Lynch, 24, a mother-of-three, was "grievously-ill served by a succession of officers, staff and their supervisors" who failed to ask questions, listen properly or follow policies in relation to domestic violence.In what the inquiry called a "tragedy unfolding in slow motion" Ms Lynch was stabbed to death by her estranged partner Percy Wright on February 3, 2005, two days after she reported an incident in which he had come to her home, smashed the front room window and threatened to cut her throat. It found that, despite repeated calls to police from Ms Lynch and her family, police failed to record the initial incident as a crime and arrest Wright at that time.Wright, 35, from Rugby, was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and sent to a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act. Yesterday, Ms Lynch's mother, Helen, who was also stabbed by Wright said the hearing would give Warwickshire police the chance to "rebuild public confidence".John Crawley, the IPCC's commissioner, said there was compelling public interest in the case. He said: "The statutory purpose of holding a discipline hearing in public is to maintain confidence in the police complaints and conduct system.A spokesman for Warwickshire police said the force believed that the IPCC's decision was unnecessary.
