A man who escaped from a prison van when it was ambushed as it took him to court was recaptured on Friday night in an armed raid.Ryan MacDonald, 20, was recaptured just after 5pm by armed officers at a house in Salford, Greater Manchester police said.He and another man were freed by a trio of armed men in Salford as their van made its way to Manchester crown court from a prison in Merseyside on 30 April.Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Shenton said: "We said on that day that we would return both men to custody and we have today made good on that promise."The last 10 days have seen intense and continued activity from the force as part of our ongoing commitment to find not only the two men but those responsible for the attack on the van."As well as this latest arrest, we have arrested and charged a number of other people in connection with what happened, and the people of Greater Manchester can be assured that we will not rest until every single person behind this incident is located and brought to justice."MacDonald was due to be sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle-taking when he escaped.His delayed hearing was held in his absence last Friday at Manchester crown court as he was jailed for seven years, 10 months.The defendant, of Salford, had pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing.Another man, Stevie McMullen, 31, appeared in court last week charged with escaping lawful custody in connection with the incident and was remanded in custody.
