People have a one in 10 risk of being a victim of crime in the highest crime districts, but only a one in 50 risk in the best, figures reveal today.Analysis of crime statistics by consultants Local Futures shows a clear urban-rural divide with the highest crime areas are being in cities.Many are in the former industrial heartlands of northern England: Nottingham, Manchester and Middlesbrough are all in the top five.However, even these badly hit areas report a fall in crime in the past year, in line with the national trend.Crime has fallen by 13.5% in Nottingham over the past 12 months, which outperforms the national average of a 10% drop.The area with the lowest level of recorded crime is Tynedale in Northumberland, followed by Teesdale, County Durham; Ribble Valley, Lancashire; and what they term Richmondshire, North Yorkshire.The huge variation in crime may help explain the mismatch between the falling crime rate and people's perception of crime. The British Crime Survey found 66% of people believe crime has increased nationally; 26% believe crime in their area has increased a little and 3% believe it has increased in their area a lot."Perception of crime tends to be affected most by television and newspaper coverage, while at local level it tends to be more informed by a resident's own experiences of the area," Local Futures reports in its Crime Barometer."There is a tendency for residents to overstate crime, with non-criminal antisocial behaviour often mistakenly viewed by local residents as examples of criminal behaviour."There is a also some evidence of a north-south divide. If London is removed from the analysis, northern England accounts for a disproportionate amount of the high crime districts.Reducing these disparities is a major challenge but crucial to prevent long-term decline, Local Futures says.The report added: "Any community experiencing high levels of crime is at a disadvantage, and faces a greater challenge in creating a quality of life offer that is important to longer-term sustainability."
