A seven-year-old girl starved to death after a catalogue of missed opportunities by social services and other professionals to intervene, a serious case review found today.The report, by the Birmingham safeguarding children board (BSCB), comes more than two years after Khyra Ishaq died at her home in the Handsworth area of the city in May 2008, following months of neglect and physical abuse.She had been withdrawn from school six months earlier and purportedly home-educated by her mother, Angela Gordon.The report found that Khyra's death could have been prevented, and occurred after the authorities "lost sight" of her.Hilary Thompson, the chair of the BSCB, said: "The serious case review concludes that although the scale of the abuse inflicted would have been hard to predict, Khyra's death was preventable."The report identifies missed opportunities, highlighting that better assessment and information-sharing by key organisations could have resulted in a different outcome."The 180-page report found that, despite concerns being raised by members of the public and school staff about Khyra's welfare as far back as March 2006, information was not acted upon and safeguarding procedures were not followed.It said there were a number of early missed opportunities for intervention by professionals. Pointing to three incidents in March 2006 which were not acted upon either through "failures of paperwork to reach the correct departments" or failures to conduct checks or follow safeguarding procedures, the review concluded: "Had there been better assessments and effective interagency communication over a period of time it [Khyra's death] could have been prevented."A complaint of harassment by Gordon against a social worker who visited their home in February 2008 generated a reluctance to complete an assessment "for fear of wider repercussions within the complaints process".The report found that some agencies "lost sight of the child and focused instead upon the rights of the adults, the adults' behaviour and the potential impact for themselves as professionals".In March, Mr Justice Roderick Evans sentenced Gordon, 35, to 15 years in prison and jailed her former partner, Junaid Abuhamza, 31, who has schizophrenia, indefinitely for the public's protection, with a minimum term of seven and a half years.During the trial it emerged that Khyra had been removed from school in December 2007 and subjected to a punishment regime which included standing outside in the cold for long periods, having cold water poured over her and being beaten with a bamboo cane.She and five other children – who cannot be identified for legal reasons – in the care of Gordon and Abuhamza were deprived of food and prevented from entering the fully stocked kitchen by a bolt fixed out of their reach on the door.A postmortem on Khyra found 60 marks, 34 of which could have happened a week before her death. Eight were consistent with being struck by a cane.There were echoes of the death of Victoria Climbié, who was abused by an aunt, before she died in Haringey, north London, 10 years ago.The serious case review made 18 specific recommendations for action across Birmingham city council, the city's primary care trusts, West Midlands police, the Birmingham Children's Trust and the safeguarding board. A further 53 areas for improvement were identified.Twelve of the recommendations relate either directly or jointly to Birmingham's children's services.The council said 10 of the recommendations had already been acted upon and three members of staff who had "significant involvement" with Khyra had been subjected to disciplinary procedures. Tony Howell, strategic director for children, young people and families at the council, would not comment on the nature of the disciplinary action.Speaking after the report was published, he said: "I know that everyone involved with Khyra and her family in my department has been deeply affected by her death."As professionals, we need to make the changes necessary to prevent such tragedies in the future. For our part we have undergone a major review of children's social care, strengthened our management team, increased capacity on the frontline and are in the process of remodelling our workforce."He insisted his department would "do whatever it takes to ensure children in this city are safe from those who would do them harm".Les Lawrence, council cabinet member for children, young people and families, said: "Today's publication of the serious case review clearly highlights the opportunities missed by a number of agencies to intervene in the abuse being inflicted on Khyra by the people she trusted to look after her."Today, as we remember Khyra Ishaq's life, we reaffirm our commitment to create a children's social care service that better protects our young people from those who would harm them. Let this be Khyra's legacy."The education secretary, Michael Gove, said that Khyra's death was preventable and that it was "beyond anyone's comprehension" that a child could die in such tragic circumstances."It is extremely difficult to prevent random and isolated incidents of violence against children, but the tragedy is that Khyra Ishaq endured a painful abuse over many months and eventually died, and this could and should have been prevented," he said. "Today's serious case review confirms that all the agencies in Birmingham failed to protect this vulnerable child."Clearly lessons need to be learned by the tragic events in this case, and I will consider the letter I expect to receive from Birmingham shortly, to see what changes need to be made to the existing arrangements, and reply in due course."
