A bus driver accused of killing a Cambridge University medical student and dragging her body for more than half a mile under his vehicle thought he had run over a bottle, and later a fox, a court has heard.Mingwei Tan was hit by a night bus as she crossed the road in the early hours of 30 September 2010 after returning from a holiday in Cyprus, it is claimed.The 20-year-old from Singapore, who was living in north London, was caught underneath the vehicle and found lying with fatal injuries 825 metres along the road, the court heard. A postmortem examination revealed she died of multiple injuries.Shahriar Firouzian, 52, of Watford, Hertfordshire, denies causing death by careless driving after he allegedly hit her as she crossed Pond Street, Hampstead, north London, jurors at Blackfriars crown court were told. He stopped to collect an elderly woman outside the Royal Free hospital shortly after the collision, at about 1.45am.Firouzian only discovered Tan had been killed the next day, when he was suspended by his employers, Metroline. He told police after the incident that he believed he had initially run over a bottle and then a fox when Tan's body eventually came free.In his statement, he said: "I think it was a bottle left behind the hospital when I picked up an old black lady." He added: "I think it was a fox just after Belsize Park rail station."Jurors were shown photographs of the scene, including the positions of a sock, shoe, mobile phone and purse which were found along the road.Firouzian sat quietly with an interpreter during the hearing. The court heard that Firouzian gained his drivers licence in Sweden and had been driving for Metroline since 2003.Hamish Reid, prosecuting, said: "It is not part of the prosecution case that when Mr Firouzian started his shift that night he intended to kill Miss Tan." He added: "He will have to live with what happened for the rest of his life."A statement from Tan's university friend Mike Money said the pair arrived at Gatwick airport at 11pm on 29 September 2010, after a holiday in Cyprus with two friends.Tan was then travelling to West Hampstead to collect luggage from a family friend before she was due to catch another flight to Rome, the court heard.She had recently also travelled home to Singapore and had planned to take part in a volunteering project in Nepal, Money said.Jurors will visit the scene where Tan is believed to have been struck by the bus on Wednesday. Expert witnesses will give evidence to the trial on Thursday and Friday.The court heard on Monday that Tan's family, who live in Singapore, are unlikely to attend the trial. The case continues.
