Kenny Richey, the Scot who spent more than two decades on death row in the United States, has been detained by police after an alleged suicide attempt in Edinburgh.The 43-year-old was taken into custody after an incident late on Friday night in which he is reported to have slashed his wrists and threatened to jump from a 40ft factory roof.Police were called to a disturbance close to the flat of Richey's mother, Eileen, in Dalry, Edinburgh, just after 10pm. Officers were forced to close off surrounding roads after the former US marine climbed onto a nearby warehouse roof and threatened to throw himself to the ground unless he was left alone. Neighbours said Richey struggled with paramedics called to the scene. It comes just days after he was arrested amid allegations that he had attacked a 63-year-old man over a £400 debt. 'He always seems to be in trouble. I think he likes the attention and can't get used to the fact that he's not such a big deal any more,' a neighbour said. 'I don't believe it was a serious attempt to harm himself, just another stunt to get everyone to look at him.'Richey was sentenced to death in 1987 for allegedly starting a fire that killed a two-year-old girl, even though there was a wealth of evidence to suggest that he was not guilty. Amnesty International described his case as 'the most compelling case of innocence we have come across on death row'.He twice had his appeals against conviction upheld by the courts, but due to the determination of prosecutors in the US not to admit they were wrong he was never released.His case became a cause célèbre, with personalities such as Susan Sarandon and Robbie Coltrane joining politicians and legal campaigners in calling for his freedom.Richey was finally able to walk from jail in January this year after prosecutors in Ohio agreed to accept a 'no contest' plea to attempted involuntary manslaughter, child endangering and breaking and entering. Although not an admission of guilt, it meant he would not be entitled to compensation for his time spent in prison.Almost penniless, except for the £50,000 he reputedly received for selling his story to a newspaper on his release, Richey arrived back in Edinburgh shortly after the New Year, but has admitted that readjusting to normal life has been a huge strain.Suffering from chronic heart disease, mouth cancer and depression, he moved into his mother's tenement flat and embarked on a round of drinking and gambling that has helped keep him in the headlines.
