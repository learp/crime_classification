It is not exactly clear why the judge has found it necessary to abandon the trial of serial killer Levi Bellfield on a charge of attempting to abduct 11-year-old Rachel Cowles.By which I mean, was it specific stories in specific newspapers, or was it the totality of the media coverage?Defence lawyers cited an "avalanche of adverse publicity", but they particularly mentioned comments in newspapers attributed to at least two former partners, plus comments in television interviews.The Old Bailey judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, described some of the coverage as "deplorable", adding that "the trigger had been pulled too soon" by the media.It therefore seems clear enough that almost all newspapers and broadcasters appear to be "in the frame." It is, after all, a strange case. Here was a man already serving a life sentence, having been convicted of two other murders, of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McConnell, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. His conviction for killing Milly Dowler was bound to lead to headlines, given the amount of coverage the girl's disappearance generated in 2002 and in every year since.I am all for the press behaving carefully to ensure that juries are not prejudiced against defendants.But this is an extraordinary case apart, is it not? Is there any juror, or would-be juror, who does not know of Bellfield's record?It will be interesting to see how the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, reacts to the judge's referral. The fact that prosecutors have decided against a retrial will have to be taken into account. It will not make any difference to what happens to Bellfield, who had previously been told that he must spend the rest of his life in jail.On the other hand, the family of Rachel Cowles might well feel it unjust that the case against Bellfield will simply remain on the file.That may weigh in the balance with Grieve, who is pursuing contempt proceedings against The Sun and the Daily Mirror over their coverage following the murder of Joanna Yeates in Bristol last Christmas.Lawyers acting for the attorney general said that articles published by the papers would have seriously prejudiced any trial Jefferies might have faced.The two titles were among newspapers heavily criticised at the time, including by me, for headlines and stories published about Christopher Jefferies, Yeates's landlord who was arrested on suspicion of the killing. He was subsequently released without charge and has since sued six newspapers for libel and invasion of privacy. He has also sued the police for wrongful arrest.
