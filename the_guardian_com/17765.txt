An 88-year-old woman was dumped by the side of the road after being caught up in a carjacking by armed robbers in the Midlands.The woman and a 37-year-old female relative were sitting in the back of a parked Ford Mondeo while its driver used a cashpoint when masked men emerged from the One Stop convenience store on Hungary Hill, Stourbridge, just after 9pm on Sunday, West Midlands police said. The robbers’ waiting getaway vehicle stalled and they stole the Mondeo, apparently not realising there were passengers in the back. They travelled a short distance down the road before forcing the women out of the car.The same men had raided a Co-op in Glebe Lane, Norton, less than an hour before the Hungary Hill heist, police said. On both occasions they threatened staff with hammers and stole cash and cigarettes. Sgt Rich Narrowmore, of West Midlands police, said: “The younger woman was slightly injured and both of them were terribly shaken by their ordeal, so we are keen to trace these men as soon as possible. “These were violent attacks with little thought for their victims and they need to be brought to justice quickly. I would urge anyone with information to contact police on 101 as soon as possible.”The Mondeo was recovered in Bromley Street, Lye, and is being forensically examined along with the stalled car, a silver Volkswagen Golf. Officers are trawling through CCTV footage in an attempt to identify the men. Anyone with information on the incident can speak anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
