Police have been granted extra time to question a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of the murder of the landscape architect Joanna Yeates.Police are not naming the suspect but a search of her next-door neighbour's flat began yesterday and is expected to continue today. The flat is registered to Vincent Tabak, a Dutch 32-year-old architectural engineer who works in Bath.Announcing the arrest yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones, of Avon and Somerset police, thanked the public and paid tribute to Yeates's family and her boyfriend, Greg Reardon.Jones, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: "I would like to thank the public for their continued support for the investigation and the information they have provided to us."I would also like to pay tribute to Jo's family and to Greg, who continue to be unfailing in their support to me and my team at what is an incredibly difficult and painful time for them."He told the media that no further details could be given."Proceedings are active and you are all reminded of the Contempt of Court Act, and therefore you will understand that we cannot discuss any more details at this stage," he said.Avon and Somerset police issued a brief statement this morning confirming that detectives had been given more time to question the arrested man."Police have this morning been granted extra time to question a 32-year-old man arrested yesterday (Thursday January 21) on suspicion of the murder of Jo Yeates," the statement said.Detectives have 24 hours to question a suspect before, in the first instance, going to a senior officer to ask for an extra 12 hours. They must then go to a magistrate if they want more time.Speaking yesterday at the family home in Hampshire, Yeates's 63-year-old father, David, said: "We are pleased that the investigation is moving forward."We know as much as you do. We were told that someone was arrested on suspicion of Jo's murder and their age."The man is the second to be arrested on suspicion of the murder of the 25-year-old. Her landlord, Chris Jefferies, was arrested on 30 December, five days after her body was found. He was released after questioning.Yeates was last seen on Friday 17 December. She left the Ram pub near Bristol city centre, where she had been drinking with colleagues and walked back to her flat in Clifton, stopping at three shops and buying a pizza and two bottles of cider.The coat and boots she was wearing were found at the flat she shared with Reardon, 27, along with her keys and phone.Reardon reported Yeates missing when he returned on 19 December after a weekend away.A missing person's search ended on Christmas Day when Yeates's body was found on a rural roadside verge three miles from her home. She had been strangled.Police have since revealed that one of her long ski socks was missing, prompting speculation that it might have been used to strangle her.Following yesterday's announcement of the arrest, search teams moved into a neighbouring flat in the building where Yeates lived at 44 Canynge Road.Tabak is registered as living at the address with his girlfriend, Tanja Morson.Officers set up a tarpaulin supported by scaffolding outside Yeates's garden flat and that of Tabak. He works in Bath for a company called Buro Happold, and moved to Bristol in 2009 from Bath. Calls from the media to Buro Happold were referred to the Avon and Somerset police press office.
