Joseph Harker is right - the failure to prosecute or discipline police officers following deaths in custody is one of the most important reasons for the lack of confidence in the police in Britain's black communities (Racist police officers must face the sack, October 24). The deaths of black people in custody remains a forgotten issue. This is why the relatives of Christopher Alder, Roger Sylvester and Michael Powell, who died in police custody in Birmingham six weeks ago, will be marching with other families to Downing Street today. They can never forget - and will never allow the government to do so.Kevin Blowe United Families and Friends CampaignDeborah Coles/Helen ShawInquest
