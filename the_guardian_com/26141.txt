The home secretary, David Blunkett, announced more cash to provide an emergency 1,000 prison places to ease the jail population crisis yesterday. But he appeared to have lost out in his budget battle to finance his flagship criminal justice reforms.The extra £174m of Treasury funds allocated to prisons and probation includes cash to fund an extension of the home detention curfew scheme, which could cut the record daily prison population of 73,000 by about 1,000. But the bulk of the extra money - £138m- will be spent on providing prison places, 760 of them in blocks to be built in the grounds of jails by the end of next year. The changes to the home detention curfew scheme will mean that qualifying prisoners serving sentences of between 18 months and four years will be released four and a half months early on an electronic tag, rather than three months early as atpresent. It is believed a proposal to increase this to six months was vetoed at a late stage. It also seems that the home secretary has failed to secure the £500m he needs over the next three years to fund early implementation of a more radical early release scheme, and other measures designed to provide a significant alternative to prison, which are part of the criminal justice bill going through parliament. The Home Office said the extra prison places, on top of existing plans for prisons, will bring the total capacity of jails in England and Wales to 78,700 by 2006. That still leaves an 11,000 gap in terms of the prison service projection of 90,000 behind bars in England and Wales by 2006.
