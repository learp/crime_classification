Lord Laming's inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbié in 2000 was followed by root-and-branch reforms but today he expressed his distress at another child dying in the same London borough, despite being known to welfare and health agencies.The child protection expert said he had hoped the north London borough of Haringey would develop services that would make it an exemplar of good practice following Victoria's death."Although our recommendations were not directed only at Haringey - they were directed nationally to all the services - I had hoped they would be a sufficient stimulus for Haringey to say: 'Never again,'" Lord Laming told the Guardian. Today's outcome of the Baby P case will inevitably prompt questions about the value of the post-Climbié reforms, which aimed to improve multi-disciplinary support for children at risk, or in need, by creating children's services departments in local councils and children's trusts. The idea was that they are not organisations like NHS trusts, but joint panels bringing together professionals from different agencies.The value of children's trusts was last month queried in a report by the Audit Commission spending watchdog, which said their role was unclear and confusing. The effectiveness of separate children's services departments has also been challenged, one in 10 councils having either kept, or reverted to, a single organisational structure for children's services and adult social care in order to maintain an holistic view of the family's needs as a whole.But the fundamental principle of reorganising professionals around the child is seen by most observers as having been sound: Laming described the government's Every Child Matters response to his report as "an outstanding statement of policy" and even the Audit Commission acknowledged that collaborative working had improved markedly.Unlike Victoria Climbié, Baby P was not a victim of a failure of communication between different agencies responsible for children's welfare.What the Baby P case calls into question is not so much the structures or systems, more the individual practice. From the paediatrician who allegedly failed to identify the toddler's probably fractured ribs and broken spine, to the social workers and health visitors who appear to have accepted excuses for lesser but regular injuries, the tragic story points to a reticence on the part of professionals to investigate, question and challenge.Harry Ferguson, professor of social work at the University of the West of England, said: "The striking thing for me is how the social workers failed to touch the child, to examine him, and the skilful deceit by the mother and cohabitants to conceal the injuries."This is known in the literature as 'disguised compliance', where superficial cooperation is a front for concealing abuse. I think it exposes structural weaknesses in how we are failing to prepare professionals well enough for the demands of checking children in their own homes, touching and examining them."Lord Laming stresses he has not followed in detail the Baby P case, but the former chief inspector of social services believes that children who deliberately harm a child often go to great lengths to disguise what they have done. "They become very clever at diverting attention away from what has happened to the child. Therefore people who work in this field - whether health visitors, police officers, social workers, whatever – have to recognise this in their evidence gathering. They have to be sceptical; they have to be streetwise; they have to be courageous."Professionals of all disciplines were too often insufficiently assertive with parents and other adults in cases of suspected abuse and too ready to accept excuses for a child's injuries or withdrawn behaviour.The same attitude was found at the top of many child welfare and health agencies, Laming said. "Too often, I am afraid, managers, like their staff, just let things drift along. Drift is the enemy of good practice in these proceedings."Inevitably, the Baby P case will also raise questions about the quality of paediatric health services in Haringey in 2006 and 2007 and why those services were being handed over to the Great Ormond Street hospital trust – a world-renowned specialist care facility, but not an experienced provider of community or district hospital services.
