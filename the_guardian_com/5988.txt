Prisoners are being held in police cells in parts of England and Wales because some jails are full and can no longer take new inmates, the Home Office said yesterday as it confirmed that Operation Safeguard is now in effect.The home secretary, John Reid, has agreed the emergency measures are "necessary and pragmatic" as the number of prisoners nears 80,000.The Home Office has confirmed that 19 police forces are ready to hold prisoners, initially, in up to 240 cells, under Operation Safeguard, which began last Saturday.Yesterday, the jail population reached 79,714, still below the record high of two weeks ago, but emergency measures had to be introduced as some areas reached capacity. Last night 47 prisoners were being held in police cells as part of the operation."A number of prisoners are being held in police cells under Safeguard but the number changes daily," a spokeswoman said. "There is potential for expansion of up to a total of 520 police cells through October and November."The prison population has surged since 1993. In the last year, more than 970 offenders have been given the new indeterminate sentence for dangerous and violent offenders, adding significantly to the prison population.The last time Operation Safeguard was used was in 2002, when it drew criticism from police forces because of the cost, but this time the number of police cells to be used has been agreed with chief constables.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, criticised the government for not planning ahead. "This crisis will have a direct effect on public safety because education and training to turn prisoners away from crime cannot work properly in police cells, or in our now hopelessly overcrowded prisons," he said."A series of Labour home secretaries, not least John Reid, have sat on their hands for years while prison numbers spiralled out of control."Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "We look to a home secretary for strategic leadership, to make sure there are enough prison places for serious and violent offenders, not desperation and pragmatism that wastes police time and public money locking up petty criminals, addicts and the mentally ill in police stations. Using police cells to warehouse prisoners is a desperate measure."
