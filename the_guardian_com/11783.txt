Labour is planning to attack David Cameron next week, accusing him of helping paedophiles escape British justice.In what is billed as a campaign to portray the Tories as soft on crime, the home secretary, John Reid, is intending to hound the Tories over their refusal to vote for extradition laws that would allow fugitives to be forced to return to the UK.Mr Reid plans to highlight the case of a Roman Catholic priest wanted in Britain in connection with paedophile charges, but who cannot be returned to the UK under current laws since the alleged offence occurring more than six years ago.Peers voted last week for the second time to exclude the US from extradition agreements due to be included in the police and justice bill.Critics of the 2003 extradition treaty, which has been sent for ratification to the US Senate by George Bush, argue the burden of proof required makes it too easy for America to demand that Britons stand trial in the US. The government claims standards of proof are broadly comparable. The issue is due to return to the Commons on Monday, and Labour plans to embarrass the Tories if they still oppose inclusion of the US.The Queen's speech, due to be published a week later, will have a strong law and order flavour.Labour, struggling in the polls, believe they have identified a key weakness in Mr Cameron's defences and plan to attack him repeatedly in the runup to the Queen's speech. Labour's focus group polling is showing that Mr Cameron is seen as facing both ways on crime, traditionally a Tory preserve.Labour believes the Tories are wrong on potential crimes of the future, symbolised by the identity cards issue; wrong on terrorism by refusing to support 90-day detention and control orders; and wrong over the use of antisocial behaviour orders and extradition.Speaking in the marginal seat of Gillingham yesterday, Mr Reid responded for the first time to claims voiced by the Youth Justice Board that Asbos were not working, either because as many as half were being breached or they were starting to be seen as a badge of honour by delinquent teenagers. Mr Reid said: "David Cameron forgets that the vast majority of teenagers are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime. Asbos help protect teenagers against the louts Cameron wants to love."
