Scotland Yard is running more counter-terrorism investigations than ever and is at full stretch as it attempts to deal with "sinister" terrorist threats, one of the force's most senior officers said today.In the run-up to the first anniversary of the July 7 bombings, Peter Clarke, the head of the anti-terrorist branch, said intelligence surrounding the terrorist threat was "very, very concerning".Mr Clarke also revealed it was "entirely possible" that criminal charges could still be brought in relation to the July 7 attacks last year, in which four bombers blew themselves up on the London public transport system, killing themselves and 52 others.Mr Clarke revealed the police were carrying out about 70 counter-terrorism investigations and the force believed it had disrupted three and probably four attacks since the London bombings.Three of these will be the subject of criminal trials in which charges would include drawing up terrorism plans and conspiracy to commit murder, cause explosions and mount poison attacks."The level of counter-terrorist investigations has intensified during the past 12 months," Mr Clarke said."There has been an unrelenting demand for intelligence to be investigated and operations conducted to arrest suspects or disrupt terrorist activity when judged to be appropriate. The Metropolitan police anti-terrorist branch has around 70 current investigations spanning London, the UK and the globe."He continued: "We have more active investigations than we have ever had before. Despite the increase in resources, we are running at or near capacity. There is a lot of intelligence to be investigated - some of it is very sinister. It is a very, very concerning intelligence picture."Mr Clarke said the changing nature of the threat meant the police had to intervene to thwart attacks much sooner than would have been necessary in previous years. There was a determination among terrorists to cause mass casualties, and officers had a duty to step in whenever there was a suspicion of a threat to public safety, he added.Five days ahead of the first anniversary of the July 7 bombings, Mr Clarke revealed how the police were "reconstructing" the events leading up to the attacks in an attempt to identify anyone who might have known they were going to happen.Officers were in close consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service and it was "entirely possible" that criminal charges could still be brought over the bombings, he said. No one has been charged in relation to the attacks no one is currently in custody.Mr Clarke said officers had taken 13,353 witness statements, there were more than 29,000 exhibits and police were still ploughing through more than 6,000 hours of CCTV footage.Sixty individuals are awaiting trial in the UK on terrorism-related offences. "This is unprecedented and the flow of new cases shows no sign of abating - if anything, it is accelerating," he said, adding that there were two other factors "even more alarming" than the gravity of the allegations."The first is that the majority relate to the activities of British citizens against their fellow countrymen and second is the extreme youth of some of those charged," he said.The reasons for the radicalisation of some young men were "very defuse and diverse", he added. There were a mixture of factors, including a perceived sense of injustice, a sense of alienation and the influence of radical Muslim clerics.The investigation into last year's London bombings remained "intensive" and was still developing, Mr Clarke said. "A great deal of progress has been made but much remains to be done."In seeking to reassure the victims, relatives and friends of those who died and suffered in the July 7 attacks, Mr Clarke said there was an "unwavering focus" on finding out the truth as to why Mohammed Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Hasib Hussain and Germaine Lindsay carried out the bombings.Mr Clarke said that, one year on, this was a time for "sober and mature reflection" to remember the victims, recall the "ghastly carnage" and understand that, for many, the suffering continued.He warned that terrorists wanted to create an atmosphere in which the British public was "not sure who or what to believe".Mr Clarke added: "It sometimes feels as if the public are not well informed about the reality of the threat, or indeed the work that is being done on their behalf to try to keep them safe." This was often because of the inevitable secrecy surrounding counter-terrorism efforts."With terrorist cases taking anything up to two years or longer to come to court, the public are unaware of many important things that have happened in this country," he said. "That is a pity and it means we must guard against blame, recrimination, speculation or myths taking the place of solid public information."At least two of the London suicide bombers had visited Pakistan and much of the investigative work has focused on trying to find out what they did there. However, Mr Clarke admitted this was proving difficult."The suspicion is that they met people connected to al-Qaida and they were attending training camps," he said. "[However,] the part of the country where these sorts of activities take place is very difficult for the Pakistani authorities and ourselves to get any detailed information about."
