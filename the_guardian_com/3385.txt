Home Office ministers yesterday discussed the possibility of imposing longer sentences for knife crime, as the recent spate of high-profile stabbings claimed two more victims. A 40-year-old woman was found stabbed to death behind flats in a quiet street in south Croydon. In north London, a teenage shop assistant was in hospital after being stabbed in the back as he tackled a gang of shoplifters. Rudy Neofytou, 19, had been working at a designer outlet store owned by the Moss Bros Group at Wood Green Shopping City.Thousands of weapons have been handed in to police since the launch of a nationwide knife amnesty last year, but the initiative has been overshadowed by recent crimes.The home secretary and other ministers discussed the government's drive in tackling knife crime amid speculation that John Reid wants the maximum jail term for carrying a knife to increase from two to five years. He voted against introducing a maximum five-year penalty when the Tories sought to amend the violent crime reduction bill six months ago, but a Home Office spokesman said: "The government is determined to tackle the devastation of knife crime. With the violent crime reduction bill going through parliament, the opportunity is there to look at ways of strengthening the law on knife possession."The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "The fact is the government voted against us when we tried to raise the maximum sentence for carrying a knife."Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: "We want the maximum penalty for carrying a knife to match that for a gun. Whether you are stabbed or get a bullet through the chest does not make much difference."The pressure on the government was led by Jan Berry, chair of the Police Federation, who gave her support to the idea of mandatory jail sentences for those carrying a knife without good reason. She highlighted a recent federation survey of 140,000 police officers, in which almost a third said they had been threatened with a knife in the past two years."It's imperative that judicial sentences reflect the gravity of the offence of being found in possession of a knife without good reason, which is clearly not the case at the moment."In Essex, a young mother, Anne Marie Cuffy, 26, was in a "serious condition" after being knifed in the stomach when she and her sister Kimberly, 18, tried to help a male friend who was being assaulted outside a pub in Purfleet.In Bristol police were yesterday questioning a 30-year-old man in connection with the stabbing of Barry Wilson, who died on his doorstep on Tuesday afternoon in front of two young daughters, allegedly after a row over money.In north London, more than 100 police officers lined the streets yesterday for the funeral of special constable Nisha Patel-Nasri, who was stabbed when she went to investigate a disturbance outside her Wembley home. Her killer is still at large.
