The home secretary, John Reid, ordered an urgent review last night into supervision regimes at bail hostels after claims that paedophiles on probation were free to befriend children.The review - which relates to claims in a BBC Panorama investigation to be broadcast tomorrow - will also examine allegations that a convicted criminal staying at a bail hostel was free to murder.Staff at a bail hostel in Bristol told Panorama said that they had given warnings armed robber Davidson Charles, 41, could re-offend before he murdered father-of-two Colin Winstone, 44.Undercover investigators spent five months focusing on two bail hostels in Bristol that both house high-risk offenders.Last night, clips from the programme, entitled Exposed: the Bail Hostel Scandal, were played on BBC News bulletins. In one section of footage, a convicted paedophile was filmed taking photographs in a busy shopping centre and loitering around public toilets.In the programme, hostel managers admit that once offenders are out of the building they have no idea what they are doing.One senior worker is secretly recorded saying: "We can keep an eye on them until they walk to the end of that path, once they turn left or right we haven't got a clue what they are doing."In a statement, Mr Reid said: "These are serious allegations and I am totally committed to protecting the public."Part of the documentary focuses on the case of armed robber Charles, who was staying at a hostel in Brigstocke Road in Bristol when he murdered Mr Winstone, who was a taxi driver in the city. Charles had been out of jail for just seven weeks when he stabbed Mr Winstone through the heart. He was later jailed for life.Panorama recorded staff at the hostel claiming they warned the probation service about him re-offending but nothing was done.One staff member was recorded as saying: "That taxi driver should never have been killed ... We provided his probation officer with enough evidence to recall him."Panorama claims Charles was supposed to be under monitoring and supervision at Brigstocke Road when he murdered Mr Winstone in January last year.The documentary also features claims that criminals were pimping and shoplifting to pay for their drug habits despite staying in a hostel supposed to specialise in weaning offenders off drugs.It is also claimed that staff were often left to deal with criminals with psychiatric health issues and histories of prolific or violent crime without proper training.One resident of the Brigstocke Road hostel, a paedophile convicted of killing a child, was filmed by Panorama repeatedly returning to flats where he had befriended a group of young mothers and their children.The BBC investigators said they called the police about his activities but the probation service was not informed.Panorama claims that another offender, James Long, jailed in February this year for the murder of 45-year-old Scott Marshall, had been a resident of Ashley House, a second bail hostel, when he carried out the killing.Mr Marshall's three-year-old son, Abraham, was left in a flat with his body for three days before friends and family became concerned and he was found.Other residents of Ashley House are witnessed in the programme going out while on heroin and stealing around town to fund their habits.In his statement, Mr Reid said: "I have asked Andrew Bridges, the chief Inspector of probation, to urgently review whether there is a case for an investigation of the management and operation of the approved premises mentioned by the programme."A spokesman for the Home Office criticised Panorama for not handing over tapes of the programme to authorities in advance and claimed it had refused the offer of an interview with the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service.The BBC said it had already interviewed an official responsible for hostels in Bristol, and had a request to speak to a minister turned down.
