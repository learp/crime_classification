A beggar who has been arrested more than 50 times was told yesterday that he faced jail if he broke an order banning him from harassing the public for cash anywhere in England or Wales.The anti-social behaviour order was made against Andrew Manion, 41, at Manchester magistrates court in what is believed to be the most wide-ranging legal action so far against a street beggar. The court heard that Manion had harassed the public in Manchester for more than three years, sitting near cash machines, car park pay stations and places of entertainment and asking for spare change. District judge Peter Ward told Manion after he pleaded guilty to a begging offence near a bank machine that he had ignored repeated efforts on the part of welfare agencies to help him. His behaviour "disfigured" the city centre: "It harasses people going about their lawful business and activities. The public should not have to pass people persistently asking them for loose change. While it is true it might not cause them alarm or distress, they are certainly facing harassment." He made the order banning Manion from begging anywhere in England and Wales for two years, and warned him he could face five years in jail if he breached the order. Manion's solicitor, Simon Harkinson, protested that the order was being used to bring the punishment of possible imprisonment to an offence that did not carry it under law.
