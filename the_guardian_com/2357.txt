The government's "42 days" counter-terror legislation faces fresh criticism today, with peers warning that a "quasi-judicial" role for parliament to debate each use of the new detention powers risks undermining the independence of judges and the chances of a fair trial for suspects.The report from the all-party Lords constitution committee, which includes the former lord chief justice Lord Woolf and the former Labour attorney-general Lord Morris of Aberavon, demolishes ministers' claims that MPs and peers are not being asked to vote on whether particular individuals should be locked up for 42 days without charge.The critical report will fuel the determination of peers to throw out the government's controversial proposal to extend the current 28-day limit on the pre-charge detention of terror suspects when parliament returns in October. The autumn is likely to be a crucial time in Gordon Brown's attempts to reassert his authority, and today's report raises the likelihood of another damaging row.The former head of MI5 Lady Manningham Buller said last month that the move was unprincipled and unworkable.The committee says the legislation asks parliament to make decisions which it is "institutionally ill-equipped to determine". The peers say there are "significant difficulties" with the requirement for both houses to debate and approve each use by the home secretary of the reserve detention power because the country is facing "a grave and exceptional terrorist threat".They say although each order will be in general terms, the reality will be that MPs and peers will be asked to approve an order which has been made in relation to inquiries into individuals, and yet they will "almost certainly need to operate without fully knowing the factual background".Their report says it is "ill-advised" to create a decision-making process that requires parliament and the judiciary to answer similar questions within a short space of time. The peers point out that a judge determining an application for extended detention will be asked to exercise powers a matter of days or even hours after what may have been a highly politicised debate in parliament. "Far from being a system of check and balances, this is a recipe for confusion that places on parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfil and arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned," the peers conclude.They say that an understandable attempt to provide democratic accountability is in fact a muddled scheme which risks inappropriately conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary. David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, said the report was a crushing condemnation. "This report is another nail in the coffin of a bill which is unnecessary, and which undermines the liberty of every man and woman in the country."The Liberal Democrats' David Howarth said the peers had exposed the misleading claim that parliament would not have to decide on individual cases.
