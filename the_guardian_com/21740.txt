A family doctor accused of killing 15 patients wrongly told the daughter-in-law of one that her mother had died, Preston crown court was told yesterday.Harold Shipman visited Angela Wagstaff at her workplace in December 1997 and told her her mother had died, but the dead woman was her mother-in-law Kathleen Wagstaff.The court was told that Mrs Wagstaff ran to her mother's house in Hyde, Greater Manchester. She knocked on the door. "I looked through the letterbox and saw my mother walking towards me," she said. "I just went hysterical." She then telephoned Shipman's surgery and was told that it was her mother-in-law who had died. Mrs Wagstaff visited the doctor's surgery the following day with her husband, Peter, to find out what had happened. "He said she had looked very grey and was sweating and blue around the mouth. He took her pulse which was very, very thready and erratic," Mrs Wagstaff said. Shipman told the couple he had phoned for an ambulance and had left her to get his bag but when he returned, she had died. Peter Wagstafff said during their visit to the surgery they had thanked Shipman for being with his mother when she died. Mr Wagstaff said he had no knowledge of his mother, who was 81, suffering from heart problems. Shipman cited coronary thrombosis as the cause of death. Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, denies murdering 15 women and forging the will of one. The case continues today.
