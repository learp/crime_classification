The Conservative party was urged yesterday to conduct an inquiry into a hate campaign carried out by one of its former parliamentary candidates against his Liberal Democrat opponents.Ian Oakley, 31, who was selected in the Labour-held seat of Watford in 2006, was sentenced yesterday to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months.St Albans magistrates said his "vile and persistent" campaign, including harassment and criminal damage aimed at dozens of Lib Dem supporters and councillors, was an attempt "to pervert the democratic process". Calling for the inquiry, his principal target, Sal Brinton, the Lib Dem candidate for Watford, said the Tories locally and nationally have never apologised nor responded in any way since Oakley pleaded guilty in August.She said it was clear that at least one other person had been involved, as Oakley had been caught on CCTV cameras getting into a car and being driven away.After the court was told that a psychiatric report revealed Oakley had a "history of mental health problems", Brinton said: "A suspended sentence is probably appropriate in the circumstances. A clear message has been sent out that you cannot pervert the democratic process."Oakley's lawyer told the court his client was "genuinely remorseful". He said that the report indicated that his medication "influenced and perhaps contributed to his irrational behaviour".Oakley first entered politics in Watford when he became campaign manager for the Conservatives in the run-up to the 2005 general election. He remains an independent councillor in Hillingdon.He was arrested after a lengthy covert surveillance operation by the police.On one of his midnight forays, when he spray painted "scum perv" on the door of a Watford councillor, a camera recorded his car registration number.Oakley admitted more than 70 offences over a two-year period after the police confronted him with fingerprint evidence from one of his poison-pen letters. He told the police he wanted to change the political landscape of Watford, a three-way marginal, and secure a Tory victory.Brinton was sent pornographic material to her home and work addresses and she got repeated silent telephone calls at night. Campaign materials addressed to "Sal Bitchton" were sent to her office, with phrases such as "go back to Cambridge, you evil bitch". Other Lib Dems had the tyres of their cars slashed.A Tory spokesman said his actions were "indefensible and highly regrettable. He is no longer a member of the party."
