Maxine Carr's release from prison was thrown into disarray yesterday when it emerged that sensitive documents relating to her new identity had been stolen from a car near Hampstead, north London.Plans for the 27-year-old had been a tightly guarded secret as the Home Office tried to avoid a tabloid witch-hunt.But yesterday, after it emerged that the documents had been stolen, it was revealed that Carr had already been moved from Foston Hall prison, near Derby.The theft happened on Tuesday afternoon but last night there was confusion about what was in the documents. Officials from the Home Office denied reports that Carr's new passport, telephone number and address were taken, but a spokesman refused to say which documents had gone, insisting the government had a "duty of care" to Carr.Police said the documents were recovered later that day on nearby Hampstead Heath. Although they did not believe that thieves deliberately targeted the car, senior detectives described the theft as a "major embarrassment". The vehicle is thought to belong to a senior Home Office official who was part of the team responsible for Carr's release.Last night a source involved in previous operations to give people a new identity told the Guardian the papers would have taken months to prepare."You will have to change everything - social security numbers, address, bank cards, the lot. If one part was known, then you have to start again."Carr was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for conspiring to pervert the course of justice by lying for Ian Huntley after he murdered the schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham. Her new identity would have been prepared by a team of senior probation officers and police.Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said the theft would set back plans for her reintegration: "It's now crucial that new documents are produced within the next few weeks to ensure her safety." Carr's jail sentence will expire on Sunday. Release turns into farce, page 6
