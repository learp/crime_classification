Pete Doherty, the rock singer and on-off boyfriend of the supermodel Kate Moss, was arrested yesterday on suspicion of drug offences hours after being spared jail for possessing heroin, crack cocaine, and cannabis.The 27-year-old Babyshambles lead singer was held on suspicion of possessing class A drugs with intent to supply after Metropolitan police officers stopped a car in east London at 2.10pm.Last night he was in custody at a nearby police station along with the 21-year-old driver of the car, who was also arrested. Earlier yesterday, a district judge had sentenced Doherty to a community order after he pleaded guilty to drug possession.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "A 27-year-old man and a 21-year-old man were arrested after a vehicle was stopped ... by plain-clothed officers who were carrying out a patrol in an unmarked police car. They were arrested on suspicion of possessing what was believed to be class A drugs with the intent to supply."Doherty had earlier looked relieved as he was told he would not be going to prison after admitting seven charges of possessing controlled drugs at a court appearance.District Judge Jane McIvor instead imposed a community order with two years' supervision and 18 months drug rehabilitation at Thames magistrates' court in east London. As well as being banned from driving for six months, Doherty was ordered to pay Â£50 costs and told to return to court for a review of his progress on May 31.The judge told the singer that his road to recovery would be long and difficult, adding: "But you are showing significant signs of compliance and effort." She also warned that he might face time in prison if he were to breach the order.Doherty's lawyer, Sean Curran, told the court yesterday that his client's struggle with drug addiction had not "run to clockwork". But he insisted that both medical experts and the probation service had noticed a marked improvement.Doherty came to prominence four years ago with his band The Libertines, who were famous for their "guerrilla gigs" in venues such as tube stations, which won them a devoted fanbase.
