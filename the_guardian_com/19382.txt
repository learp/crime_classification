It was the use of hand-grenades that made Dale Cregan's attacks so unusual. In three of the four killings in Manchester last year, grenades were thrown at the bodies of Cregan's victims after they were shot. It was a rare and violent signoff seen by police as his "calling card" and described by his own barrister as "overkill".After Cregan handed himself in following the murders of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes on 18 September last year, Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester police (GMP), said he feared not all of Cregan's grenades had been found and so "the threat is still there".But a raid this month on a house in Glodwick, Oldham led to the recovery of 10 hand-grenades believed to be from the same batch as those used by Cregan. "We believe we have now recovered all of the grenades from that batch," said a police spokesman.Police and prosecution lawyers demanded a strict media blackout following the raid, fearing the news could prejudice the jury before they returned their verdicts.Detectives do not know how Cregan got his hands on the weapons, but have established they were former Yugoslavian military issue. "Greater Manchester police is co-operating with a number of national and international agencies to understand how these grenades made their way on to the UK mainland," a spokeswoman said.It is not the first time Yugoslavian grenades have been used by criminal gangs in the north-west of England. Last year a gang in Liverpool were given life sentences for a series of gun and grenade attacks in Merseyside, including one incident in which they threw grenades into a room where a woman babysitting her seven-year-old grandson was sleeping.After the police officers were killed last year, Patrick Mercer, an MP and ex-army officer, said: "These grenades are readily available on the black market and easy to conceal on your person and use. We are seeing a move from explosives being used by terrorists to being used by criminal gangs, which is extremely alarming. It introduces a completely different dimension into protection for police officers."
