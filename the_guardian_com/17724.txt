Tony Blair promised this week that John Reid's law and order and immigration reforms would be the centrepiece of the legislative programme that will make up his last Queen's speech as prime minister. But what will this legacy look like for a prime minister who became leader of the Labour party having tried to convince his party that "crime is a socialist issue"?It is a tradition, more often honoured in the breach these days, that ministers do not talk about what is in the Queen's speech before Her Majesty gets up to deliver the script written for her by No 10. But Whitehall sources, shall we say, have already given a clear indication of what the likely contents of these flagship bills are going to contain. Many of the proposals were contained in the three "action plans" that Dr Reid published as part of his 100-day drive to make the Home Office "fit for purpose" in the wake of Charles Clarke's departure over the foreign prisoners scandal.It will not surprise anyone who has followed the law and order media coverage this year that a shake-up in sentencing is a key feature of the package with the introduction of unanimous decisions by parole boards on the release of life-sentenced prisoners and the abolition of automatic sentence discounts of one third for an early guilty plea, amid a wider shake-up of sentencing.There will be tougher penalties for carrying knives and a new violent offender's order - similar to a sex offender's order - that will restrict the movements of convicted violent criminals after their release.More surprisingly, there will a major extension of the summary justice powers that police officers can dispense on the street without having to take the suspect to court first. These are likely to prove highly controversial with some initial "instant justice" ideas from the police already stirring strong debate. Amongst the proposals floated last month for these "supercops" would be powers for the police to ban yobs from town centres at night and the power to seize the cars of youngsters who drive without insurance, MOT or tax with the extra power to order the cars to be crushed.The criminal justice bill, the 38th since Tony Blair came to power in 1997 on one count, will also include a renewed attempt to introduce a market into the probation service. This bill has already been published but postponed twice before.The second major piece of legislation, probably to appear next spring, will involve a further shake-up of the ill-fated immigration and nationality directorate at the Home Office. The most controversial aspect will be an independent attempt to calculate an annual assessment of the migration needs of the British economy, which will be widely seen as setting an annual limit on immigration. A migration advisory body is to be set up to carry a national economic assessment each year of the country's labour needs with a report to parliament. It will mark a major shift in Labour policy on immigration. The tougher penalties on firms that employ illegal migrants promised by Mr Blair to the TUC earlier this month will also feature.But it is likely that a third piece of legislation which is designed to consolidate all the many different emergency laws to deal with terrorism since 2000 will prove the most difficult for Mr Blair to get through parliament. Gordon Brown hinted strongly this week that they will come back with a further extension of the 28 days without-charge detention powers of the police, if Scotland Yard can make a strong enough case for doing it; and the attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, has also made clear that the introduction of phone tap evidence in organised crime trials is firmly on the agenda.It promises to provoke fierce clashes over the balance between security and liberty, with Gordon Brown's newfound interest in a written constitution making for an interesting new twist to the civil liberties debate.
