Detectives have reopened a murder inquiry into the killing of a retired nurse in a Cambridgeshire village. Elsie Freeman, 76, was beaten to death at her home in Impington in March 1998.Detectives believed the pensioner was killed when a burglary went wrong. Now fresh DNA evidence is giving them hope they may catch her killer. Freeman was described as a recluse and detectives said though they took more than 700 statements, their first investigation was hampered by a lack of information about the pensioner. She was discovered by her nephew, David Missen, three days after her death.
