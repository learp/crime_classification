The Archbishop of York has joined critics of the government's opt-out from the EU's new directive on sex trafficking, describing the decision as "stunning".Dr John Sentamu accused ministers of "sitting on the sidelines" while other countries try to tackle a cross-border problem which is thought to be growing but has seen fewer traffickers jailed this year than at any time since 2005.The archbishop said that the "evil trade which is nothing less than modern-day slavery" required joint international action with Britain playing a full part. Estimates suggest that some 2,500 foreign women have been pimped into prostitution by gangs.Writing in the Yorkshire Post, Dr Sentamu said: "I am no great supporter of European directives because of the supremacy of our parliament, but this one seems to be common sense, designed to coordinate action against the trade in slaves. Britain should get involved now and be part of improving the situation â€“ not sat on the sidelines offering wise words only when the match is over."He compared the government's stance to him sitting silently in the House of Lords during debates on the sex trade."That is not how lawmakers should operate. Our government should be ensuring that Britain leads the way, as it did in the days of William Wilberforce," he said.His plea for a change of heart follows a similar appeal from the Labour party earlier this week, backed by the charity Anti-Slavery International. The Home Office said that caution over the directive protects damage to other national interests, but that the country is already "working constructively with EU partners" to fight sex trafficking.
