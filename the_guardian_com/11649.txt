A murder investigation has been launched after a woman was found stabbed to death at a house in Bradford. West Yorkshire police said they were seeking a man in connection with the death, which is being treated as a domestic incident.Neighbours said the victim, named locally as mother of two Nadia Khan, was six months pregnant when she died, but that is yet to be confirmed by police. Officers and paramedics were called to an address on Holker Street in Bradford just before 5pm, according to a police statement.DCI Jim Dunkerley said: “The body of a woman was found by police and paramedics inside a property on Holker Street. She had suffered fatal stab wounds. This was a very serious incident and will understandably cause a considerable amount of distress and upset amongst the local community.“To reassure local people, we have increased patrols by neighbourhood officers in the area, and I do not believe there is any wider danger to members of the public.”Abdul Khan, a family friend, told the Bradford Telegraph & Argus: “She was a nice woman, who kept herself to herself. It is so bad.”Another neighbour said: “She was a very good girl. She was just talking to me last night about going to Ikea on Monday. I was going to take her. I cannot believe it. She was so sweet, always laughing and joking.”
