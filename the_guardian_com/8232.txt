Police are investigating the suspicious deaths of three golden eagles and at least two other birds of prey on a prestigious Highland estate where Madonna married Guy Ritchie.The dead birds – all protected species – were found on Skibo estate, a 3,000 hectare (7,500 acre) grouse moor and exclusive members-only hotel overlooking the Dornoch firth north of Inverness last weekend, prompting a major police inquiry.The discovery of the golden eagles, plus a dead buzzard and a dead sparrowhawk, is one of the largest single incidents involving the suspected persecution of birds of prey in recent years.Birds of prey are persecuted particularly on shooting estates by gamekeepers who blame them for killing grouse, pheasant and partridge reared as game; most frequently they are poisoned, shot or trapped.The bodies are now being examined for possible poisoning, in breach of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, at the Scottish government's agricultural science laboratories on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Skibo was bought for £23m in 2003 by Ellis Short, an American multi-millionaire investment banker and the owner of Sunderland Football Club. Madonna and Ritchie married at Skibo castle in 2000 when the estate was owned by Peter de Savary.There is no suggestion or evidence that Short or his staff are under investigation, and the police have made no arrests.A statement from Skibo castle said: "The owners and management of Skibo Castle are committed conservationists and do everything they can to support the welfare of wildlife and birds. We will cooperate fully with the authorities in their investigation."The estate, on the border between Sutherland and Caithness, includes two farms, forests, grouse moors and landscaped parkland alongside an 18-hole golf course and several artificial lochs.Skibo also sits within a legally-designated area designed to protect birds of prey known as the Strath Carnaig and Strath Fleet Moors. The moors are a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area under UK and European environment laws to conserve hen harriers, one of the UK's rarest birds of prey.The golden eagle is one of Britain's rarest birds. It is close to extinction in England but there are about 440 breeding pairs in Scotland, chiefly in western and northern areas.The species has found it very difficult to recolonise the area around Inverness, with deliberate persecution being blamed by ecologists.The find is being investigated by Northern constabulary and specialist detectives from the national wildlife crime unit, a UK-wide police body based in North Berwick, together with the conservation agency Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and wildlife crime specialists from the RSPB.In a brief statement this morning, Northern constabulary said: "Police are investigating the deaths of three golden eagles and other birds of prey which have been found in the East Sutherland area during the past week."Officers are working closely with their partners at the RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage and the National Wildlife Crime Unit. The birds have been sent for forensic analysis in Edinburgh and police are awaiting the results."An RSPB Scotland spokesman said: "Subject to confirmation by the authorities, this is an extremely serious incident. Our staff are working closely with the Northern constabulary, the national wildlife crime unit and Scottish Natural Heritage to assist with the police investigation."The disclosure brought a furious reaction from Luke Borwick, chairmanof the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association (SRPBA), the main country landowners body. "I am appalled, disgusted, horrified by this news," he said "If this is as a result of criminal activity, this has to stop."A study by SNH found that in the surrounding region, well over one-third of the golden eagles' possible territories were unoccupied.The latest official figures show that two golden eagles, four red kites 19 buzzards were killed illegally in Scotland last year. A Scottish government map recording all confirmed deaths between 2005 and 2009 shows the area around Inverness is one of several persecution hotspots in the Scotland highlands.
