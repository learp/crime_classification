The home secretary, Charles Clarke, today urged police and local authorities to name and shame adults and children handed antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos).Home Office guidance advises councils and the police that naming and shaming people given Asbos by the courts should be the rule rather than the exception.The home secretary said: "Many offenders think that they are untouchable and above the law. If they thought that there would be a news blackout on their actions they must now think again. "Publicising Asbos has been tested in the courts and today we are making the position crystal clear - your photo could be all over the local media, your local community will know who you are, and breaching an ASBO could land you in prison."Mr Clarke will remind people handed antisocial behaviour orders that their names and photographs can be published in newspapers and leaflets, and appear on TV and radio.Under the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003 the press already has the power to name those handed Asbos.Former home secretary David Blunkett said at the Labour conference in Brighton last September that he would make it harder for defendants to appeal for anonymity.He indicated there may be guidance to judges and magistrates ordering them not to grant anonymity to perpetrators - something which he said he believed happened too frequently.The name and shame tactics have been controversial, with civil rights group Liberty claiming it could lead to vigilante attacks on people identified.In a test case last October, the high court ruled in favour of Brent council, north London, which had published the names and photographs of three teenage gang members who had been given Asbos.But the court said the authorities needed to consider the human rights of those involved and ensure that any publicity was proportionate. In October, the Home Office revealed that the number of Asbos handed out in the previous 12 months was 2,600 - double the number issued in the previous four years.Ministers estimated that at least 100,000 incidents of antisocial behaviour had been dealt with in the 12 months. However, the department's own research indicated that on just one day in September 2003, police and other officials recorded 66,107 incidents of antisocial behaviour, amounting to one every two seconds or 24.1m a year. * New home office figures show the proportion of people given Asbos who later breached them has risen from 46% in 2003 to 42% last year. Around half of those people were jailed.
