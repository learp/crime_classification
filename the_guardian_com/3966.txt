A man has been found dead after shooting his partner twice in the head while she was out with her one-month-old grandson in a pram.The man is believed to have had a history of violence, said residents in the village of Feltwell, Norfolk, where the shooting took place yesterday.The 40-year-old woman has not been identified by police, but was named by villagers as Rachel Puttock. She is now in Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge, where her condition was said to be "not life threatening". Her one-month old grandson received a bump to the head.She was shot by the 52-year-old man, believed to be Mark Osler, in broad daylight before he fled the scene at 11.15am.One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said he heard shots and came out of his house to find a woman lying on the pavement bleeding from the head. He said the woman was able to chat and to walk to an ambulance.Armed police carrying out a search for the man an hour later found his body with gunshot wounds to the head in a nearby field. It is believed he shot himself.It was claimed by residents that the man had been given a suspended jail sentence in January 2009 after he admitted putting another former partner "in fear of violence," and had been having an "on-off" relationship with Puttock.Police said they were still investigating the two incidents and how Osler came into possession of a gun.A police spokesman said officers were called to the scene after "concerns were raised for the safety of a female".He said: "Upon arrival at the scene, a woman was found with a head injury and has subsequently been taken to [hospital] where her condition is not thought to be life threatening."The body of a male believed to be the suspect was located nearby a short time later. His death is not being treated as suspicious and officers are not looking for anyone else."The spokesman added: "It's believed that the people involved in this incident were known to each other and there is no threat to the wider community."One resident said: "Ossie was unpredictable man. The police know about him, the courts know about him. He was at Norwich crown court last year and got a suspended sentence."Another said: "He could never, ever have had a licence for a gun."Police said the man and the woman were "known to each other" and detectives were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
