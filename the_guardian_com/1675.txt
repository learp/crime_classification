The farmer charged with shooting dead a suspected burglar at his home was last night expected to be released on bail again.On Thursday Tony Martin, 54, of Emneth, Norfolk,had been taken into custody after his bail was revoked. Yesterday a judge at Norwich crown court yesterday restored bail pending his trial for murder and grievous bodily harm.Last night the crown prosecution service said that Mr Martin, who was in the hospital wing of Norwich prison, would be freed once a bail condition had been met. Mr Martin had been in custody since a shooting at his isolated farmhouse on August 20, but was released on bail on Tuesday after a hearing behind closed doors when Judge David Mellor said he must live at a secret address outside Norfolk and only return to the county to attend court or with police permission.The judge ordered Mr Martin back into custody on Thursday while attempts were made to find him a new address where he could stay and meet his bail conditions.Mr Martin is accused of murdering Fred Barras, 16, of Newark, Nottinghamshire. He is also accused of causing grievous bodily harm to Brendon Fearon, 29, also of Newark, during the same incident.Police have received threats against the farmer, and when out on bail he is understood to have had a police guard.
