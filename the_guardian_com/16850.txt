Parents in south-west London have been warned to keep vigilant after police received reports of multiple attempted child abductions in the past week.Officers told parents in the Merton area to “be aware on school runs” after three incidents took place in Wimbledon and Raynes Park since 7 June.The Evening Standard reports that in one incident a man in a white van pulled up to a young boy at the junction of Church Road and Burghley Road and asked if he wanted a lift to King’s College school. After the boy repeatedly refused and walked away, the driver reportedly said: “I’ll give you credit for soldiering on like that.” Parents in Sutton were also informed that students have been approached by unknown adults twice in the space of a week, according to the paper. In a letter, revealed on Facebook, staff at Overton Grange school said a man, described as in his 40s or 50s, white, fat and bald, approached a Year 8 girl and asked her to get into his black van in Devonshire Road. The letter added that extra staff had been deployed on roads near the school at the end of the day in response to the incident.A spokesman for the Metropolitan police told the Guardian: “Police in Merton are aware of three reports of incidents of either attempted abductions or suspicious behaviour on the borough since 7 June. There have been no people harmed during any of the reported incidents.“To date, the descriptions of the vehicles and drivers given by the children are different and involve both male and female drivers. Patrols have been increased in the area. Police are working with local authority partners to ensure appropriate personal safety advice is available. Inquiries continue.”
