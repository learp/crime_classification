Fraud from fuel duty and VAT last year, amounted to £13bn, according to a report published yesterday by MPs. The figure is three times the size of benefit fraud and is equivalent to the entire annual spending budget for the Home Office.The Commons public accounts committee called for tougher action by Revenue & Customs, citing particularly the £850m illegal fuel trade, usually the sale of reduced-tax agricultural "red diesel" to private motorists.Convictions for fuel duty fraud increased to 21 in 2003-04 from 11 the previous year, while the average sentence went up to 15 months from 11.5 months.Edward Leigh, the chairman of the committee, said: "While there has been some improvement in cutting losses, a mountain of money is still being lost."The Registered Dealers Scheme for hydrocarbon oils was established successfully, but the department seriously underestimated the number of traders dealing in rebated oils. Traders have been slow to adopt electronic returns and a target should be set for them to do so."He added: "Few fraudulent traders have been brought to justice. Who can believe that potential crooks are being effectively deterred?"A committee member, Richard Bacon, Conservative MP for South Norfolk, said: "When you look at what these losses could actually pay for, you get some idea of the staggering amounts of money that are simply disappearing every year."The report said Revenue & Customs had reduced the level of VAT fraud from some 15.8% of all VAT collected to 12.9%.
