A father was stabbed to death with a screwdriver after going to "remonstrate" with two robbers who had stolen his iPhone, a jury has heard.Keith Soons, 36, who had a baby daughter, died from the single wound to his head after confronting the two thieves, the court was told.Michael Sexton, 28, and Richard Smith, 27, who are charged with murdering Soons, admit they were at the scene of the attack in Cheltenham, but blame each other for delivering the fatal blow.Soons was found lying dying in the street at 8am on 5 February this year, five hours after the attack. He died in hospital the same day.William Mousley QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Bristol crown court on Monday that although the murder weapon was never found, the wound bore all the hallmarks of being inflicted by a screwdriver."He lost his life over a mobile phone," he told the jury. "The prosecution cannot say which of the two actually inflicted the fatal injury but they were both together at the relevant time."Each accepts that he was there, each blames the other and denies having any part in the killing of Mr Soons. In fact, the prosecution say that both are culpable."They had both robbed him, they had both been acting together before and during and they continued to act together after the attack."They left Mr Soons seriously injured â€“ neither of them called an ambulance. It is possible that with quicker treatment he might have survived, albeit with significant residual mental problems."Soons' wallet and a ring he had been wearing were later recovered, the jury was told, but his mobile phone has never been found.Sexton, of Cheltenham, denies murder but admits robbery. Smith, also of Cheltenham, denies murder and robbery.The trial continues.
