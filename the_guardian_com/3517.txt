An inquest into the death of four children and their mother in a suspicious house fire in Essex has been opened.Sabah Usmani, a doctor, her sons Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, and Rayan, six, and her 12-year-old daughter, Hira, all died of burns and inhalation of fumes, postmortem examinations found.The bodies could be released for funerals by the end of Wednesday. Three-year-old Maheen, who was rescued by firefighters along with Muneeb, who died in hospital, remains in a critical condition. She is being treated in the specialist burns unit at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, Essex.The only other survivor from the blaze at the end-of-terrace home in Harlow in the early hours of Monday was father and husband Abdul Shakoor, also a doctor, who police said fought hard to save his family. He is recovering in the adult burns ward at the Broomfield, after being transferred there from the Princess Alexandra hospital, where he works, so that he could be nearer his daughter.A hospital spokesman said there had been "no real change in the condition of either patient".Before adjourning the inquest, deputy coroner Eleanor McGann said: "I would like to extend my sympathies to all of the people who know those who died in this terrible fire and to Dr Shakoor and other family members."Harlow council announced it would open a book of condolence at the town's civic centre on Thursday for anyone wishing to pay their respects.Council leader Mark Wilkinson said: "We know how hard this tragedy has hit the local community. This is a time when people want to show those affected that they are thinking of them and pay their respects to those who have lost their lives."Essex police are searching for a motive for the suspected arson attack. They have ruled out a racist motive and have dismissed rumours the fire was caused by a serial arsonist.
