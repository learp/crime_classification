Victims of rape face a postcode lottery of treatment from the police and counsellors, new Home Office research shows.There is a lack of specialist sexual assault centres (Sarcs), which means only a minority of victims receive the best support after a rape attack. The centres provide medical treatment and counselling, but help the investigation by gathering crucial evidence. They also cut the number of cases where a women withdraws the allegation before the case gets to court.The government has set a target of 16 centres by the autumn, including three in London, but the police want double that number to ensure all women can access the same services. A victim of the M25 rapist Antoni Imiela, who was treated at one of the centres, has described how important the support she received was to her recovery.Ann Fawcett (not her real name), who was attacked at knifepoint by Imiela while she walked her dog on Wimbledon Common in 2002, said: "I don't think I could have recovered as easily if I hadn't gone through that process." She is attending the opening today of a new Sarc at the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel. A Home Office spokeswoman would not discuss the research, but said: "In the last financial year, the government made £300,000 available for the development of Sarcs. "This money was used to expand services provided at three existing Sarcs, and to help establish six new Sarcs. "Over this current and the next financial year, the government will provide £4m of proceeds of crime money for services to victims of sex offending. Part of this will be used to develop the Sarcs network further."
