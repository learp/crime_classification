A teenager who murdered a promising A-level student as he tried to recover a stolen smartphone has been jailed for a minimum of 13 years.Dogan Ismail, 17, suffered a single stab wound to the heart as he tried to get back a BlackBerry stolen from a 15-year-old during an altercation two days earlier.his killer, Dawda Jallow, 15, from Peckham, south-east London, was ordered to serve at least 13 years of a life sentence after he was found guilty of murder by a jury. Before passing sentence at the Old Bailey, Judge Christopher Moss took the unusual step of lifting an order granting him anonymity as a minor.The judge told Jallow that the attack was carried out with "force and ferocity", but added that he could not be sure whether he intended to kill his victim.Jallow stared at the ground as his sentence was read out, with members of his and his victim's families looking on.Jallow had been caught carrying a knife twice before the attack took place on 30 December last year, the court heard.His mother had sent him back to the Gambia, where the family are originally from, in a bid to keep him out of trouble, but when he returned he was said to have been disruptive at school. Moss described him as a "troubled boy who appeared to have a difficult background" due to the lack of a relationship with his father. "You have said you recognise the effect that your actions have had on those who loved [Dogan] and I can only hope that is the case," he said.In a victim impact statement read out in court on her behalf, Dogan's mother, Ozel Ismail, said the killing had plunged her and her family into a "living nightmare".Speaking of the love she felt for her first-born child, she said he had been "worth every sleepless night".She described him as a highly ambitious boy with dreams of setting up a business of his own, adding: "He was responsible, caring and a young man with integrity ..."I had dreams with Dogan – his first job, his first car, his first serious girlfriend. Those dreams have been stolen from me and have died with Dogan."The crime happened after another 15-year-old had his BlackBerry stolen on the Aylesbury estate in Walworth, south London, on 28 December last year.On 30 December, Dogan and the smartphone's owner went back to the estate to try to reclaim it. They confronted Dogan's killer, who went into a flat and returned with what police described as a large knife.The Walworth Academy sixth-form student was found outside Latimer House in Beaconsfield Road by paramedics, but despite their efforts he was pronounced dead at the scene.Police decided to name Jallow as a suspect on New Year's Eve and pictures were later released of him travelling on the number 35 bus from Camberwell Green to Newington Causeway eight hours after the killing.After two weeks on the run, he handed himself in to police and later admitted manslaughter and theft before being found guilty of murder.The murder was the second fatal knife attack on the Aylesbury estate in just four months – Shaun Chambers, 21, was stabbed to death in the same spot last September.Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner welcomed the sentence for what he described as an "appalling and violent attack"."Jallow did all he could to evade capture in the weeks following the attack, until he realised there was nowhere left to run," he said."He will now spend a significant amount of time behind bars for the callous crime that he has committed."
