Families of the victims of the serial killer Harold Shipman threatened yesterday to seek a judicial review of the government's decision to hold an inquiry into the deaths in private, and indicated that they might boycott the inquiry."All the relatives feel they've been fobbed off," said Ann Alexander, the families' solicitor. "It was due to [them] that the murder inquiry got off the ground. Now they've had the door slammed in their faces." Shipman, a GP who had a surgery in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was jailed for life in January for the murder of 15 women. Their relatives, and the relatives of other victims - whose deaths did not lead to further charges against him - are among 49 families represented by Ms Alexander. The inquiry is expected to begin its formal hearings in Manchester next month. The families reacted angrily when they learned evidence would not be taken in public. They say they will not be entitled to read written statements or hear the verbal evidence.
