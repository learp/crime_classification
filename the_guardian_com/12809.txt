The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is considering launching an investigation into whether police could have helped prevent the murder of two young children found dead in Sussex last week after it emerged they were aware of family concerns about the children's safety.Sussex police admitted today that they had "limited contact" with the family before the double murder. The force has referred part of its inquiry to the IPCC, which is considering its response.The children, three-year-old Harry and his two-year-old sister, Elise, were found dead in the boot of car last Wednesday in Heathfield, East Sussex, after their mother, Fiona Donnison, contacted the police. She was remanded in custody by Lewes magistrates on Saturday and transferred to a medium-secure psychiatric unit after being charged with their murders.It was reported that the children's father, Paul Donnison, who was estranged from their mother, had expressed concern to police about their safety.Sussex police announced today that they had voluntarily referred that aspect of the investigation to the police watchdog for "objectivity and transparency".A statement said: "Sussex police had last week commenced a full review of our limited contact with the family prior to 27 January and that review is ongoing."At present, no issues of concern have been identified, but to emphasise the objectivity and transparency of the actions being taken, this aspect of the overall investigation has today been voluntarily referred to the IPCC."An IPCC spokesman said: "We received a referral from Sussex police this morning and are currently considering its contents."Yesterday the children were remembered at church services in Heathfield and almost 70 miles away in Lightwater, Surrey, the village they moved to with their mother last September.Initial postmortem examination results showed that Harry and Elise died from asphyxia and had been dead for less than 24 hours when their bodies were found.
