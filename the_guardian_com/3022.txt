The former housekeeper of the attorney general, Baroness Scotland, lied to her when she applied to start work as her cleaner, a court heard today.Loloahi Tapui confessed to lying to Baroness Scotland by claiming she had mislaid her passport when she was confronted by the attorney general about allegations she had overstayed her visa in September last year, Southwark crown court in London heard.But the 27-year-old's Tongan passport, which clearly showed she had overstayed her leave to remain in the UK by four years, was found by police on a bookshelf in the living room of her home in Sutton Court Road, Chiswick, west London.Duncan Penny, prosecuting, told the jury of eight men and four women: "When the defendant offered herself for employment in January 2009 the crown alleges that she acted dishonestly, making a false representation that she was entitled to work in the UK."When her true status came to light and she was confronted about her status by Baroness Scotland, the defendant admitted she lied during the application process about the whereabouts of her passport."Baroness Scotland, the chief law officer for England and Wales, will be called as a prosecution witness later today and asked to be referred to as Patricia Mawhinney.She was fined Â£5,000 in September last year for failing to keep a copy of the documents which Tapui provided to show she was entitled to work in the UK when she applied for the cleaner's job, the court heard.Tapui admits possessing a passport with a counterfeit visa stamp between 7 June 2006 and 19 September 2009, but denies using it to establish facts about herself and earn money.The false stamp purported to be issued on 12 September 2005 and claimed she had been granted leave to remain in the UK on certain conditions until 12 September 2008.Tapui denies intending to use the false identity document "for establishing, ascertaining or verifying registrable facts about herself", including her "identity and residential status".She also denies fraud by dishonestly making a false representation that she was entitled to work in the UK.The trial, which is expected to last three to four days, started moments after prime minister Gordon Brown announced the general election will take place on 6 May.Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith warned the jury to try the case on the evidence before them and to ignore any press reports.
