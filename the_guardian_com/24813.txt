It was a case, the defence barrister acknowledged, that, had it been presented to the producers of the Scottish crime drama Taggart, would have been scoffed at as too fantastical to be true.A young Polish woman murdered and buried under the floorboards of a Catholic chapel, an alcoholic priest who admitted having a sexual relationship with the dead woman, her married lover and his apparently complicit wife, and the homeless handyman accused of killing the young woman in an attack of quite breathtaking brutality.But as the trial judge Lord Menzies noted, this was not a murder mystery; it was one of the more remarkable murder trials to take place in Scotland in recent years. Today a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found Peter Tobin, 60, guilty of the murder of Angelika Kluk, 23, concluding a case that was described in court as "sensational and bizarre in the extreme".The young woman had been bludgeoned repeatedly about the head, raped, gagged and tied up and then stabbed 16 times in the chest, before her body was unceremoniously dumped beneath the floor of the chapel, in an underground chamber next to the confession box. So shocking were her injuries that members of the public were removed from the court before pictures of her body could be shown.Ms Kluk, a student from Skoczow near Krakow who was living at St Patrick's church in central Glasgow, knew her killer as Pat McLaughlin, a genial handyman who helped out around the church. Tobin was arrested in London under a fake name after Strathclyde police made a public appeal.The conviction brought to a conclusion a trial that for six weeks has transfixed Scotland, as daily lurid revelations of ecclesiastical intrigue and sexual obsession have emerged.Father Gerry Nugent, 63, the parish priest, told the court that he and Ms Kluk had had a short sexual relationship in 2005, and admitted that he was an alcoholic; Tobin's defence QC had argued in his closing speech that there was "clear evidence" to connect the priest in some way with the young woman's death. The jury of eight women and seven men also heard from Martin Macaskill, 40, with whom Ms Kluk had been conducting a passionate affair of a few weeks when she died; Mr Macaskill's wife Anne had been aware of the relationship and was apparently prepared to tolerate it. A 65-year-old Aberdeen sheriff, Kieran McLernan, who had been teaching the dead woman golf, also gave evidence.Ms Kluk, a student of Norwegian at Gdansk university in Poland, was a regular visitor to Glasgow in academic holidays, where her older sister lived and where she worked as a cleaner to earn money for her course. A devout Catholic, she first came to St Patrick's church in the summer of 2005, and moved into the attached parochial house after Fr Nugent offered her a room rent-free in exchange for some cleaning duties. Though the pair, Fr Nugent said, had had a brief sexual liaison which had soured, she returned to the church the following summer.She was last seen on September 24 last year, in the company of Tobin, whom she had been helping to paint a shed; her partly decomposed body was discovered five days later. She had been due to return to Gdansk to resume her studies within days.Tobin first became associated with St Patrick's around six weeks before the murder, when he started attending a twice-weekly homeless soup kitchen held at the chapel. He began turning up at the church every day offering to do odd-jobs and rapidly became, the parish priest said, "a godsend".His defence had argued in court that he and Ms Kluk had a consensual sexual relationship, which explained the presence of his sperm in the dead woman's knickers and vagina, but that he had not killed her. But the quantity of forensic evidence against him was overwhelming: his DNA was also found on a kitchen cloth stuffed into her mouth, his fingerprints were on items found with the body, and a pair of jeans steeped in her blood had been abandoned in a wheelie bin at the church complex. Consultant patholgist Julie McAdam told the court that the frenzied blows to the woman's chest suggested that the murder had been sexually motivated.St Patrick's, situated in an abandoned wasteland of tower blocks and tangled motorway flyovers in Glasgow city centre, has been closed since the killing; a church spokesman said it was likely to reopen in late summer following a service of "cleansing". Fr Nugent resigned last month as a priest at the request of his diocese and the congregation has been scattered.This week a number of long-dead bouquets of flowers remained attached to the railings of the abandoned church. One faded note read: "In the hope that the darkness will not overshadow the light and all the good done."
