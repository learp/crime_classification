A driver who was tracked down by police, nine days after she fled on foot from the scene where she knocked down and fatally injured an 11-year-old boy, has pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.Hannah Saaf, 27, from Kingsdown in Bristol, appeared before Bristol crown court charged with causing the death of Sam Riddall on 1 May, when her car mounted the pavement at Westbury-on-Trym, and ploughed into a group of children walking home from a church youth group.The accident happened at about 9.15pm, when the friends were returning from the Henleaze and Westbury community church. Saaf fled the scene where Sam lay fatally injured, abandoning her white Ford Focus. Desperate attempts to revive the boy at Bristol Royal Infirmary failed and he was declared dead later that night.A police hunt followed, with ferry and airports notified, and dogs and helicopters searching Bristol and surrounding west country areas where Saaf was known to have lived or have friends. After she had been on the run for five days, Avon and Somerset police took the unusual step of naming Saaf and releasing her image to the media.A week after Sam's death, his parents, Martin and Rachel, made a public appeal for Saaf to turn herself in.The distraught couple paid tribute to their "wonderful" son and said their three other sons were "full of questions that we can't even begin to answer".Nine days after Sam's death, Saaf was found sleeping in a barn in the village of Publow, 10 miles from the scene of the crash. She was charged on 11 May with causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop or report an accident, and driving without insurance.After today's court appearance, the Riddalls released a statement through their church, paying further tribute to their son. "The last three months have been an incredibly painful and difficult time, we miss our lovely Sam so much," they said. "We have been overwhelmed by the love and support that we have experienced from our friends and families, our church, our local community and many people around the country and are so thankful for all the cards, letters and prayers from so many people."This love and support is helping us to get through each day. Sam asked the big questions of life and we had lots of opportunity to talk with him about heaven. Knowing that he is there now and that we will see him again one day gives us great hope and we continue to cling to our faith in a loving God to help us make sense of this awful tragedy."
