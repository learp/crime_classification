A single mother put police and journalists to shame in their attempts to unravel the mysterious reappearance of the canoeist John Darwin by using a simple Google search, it emerged yesterday.The woman found the picture that apparently shows Darwin with his wife, Anne, in Panama City in July last year.When confronted with the picture, which was published in the Daily Mirror yesterday, Anne Darwin is reported to have admitted: "Yes, that's him. My sons will never forgive me."The photograph was available on a website of the firm Move to Panama. It was found by the anonymous woman after she tapped in the words "John, Anne and Panama" into Google. She forwarded the picture to Cleveland police and the Mirror. She said that when she sent the picture to detectives, she was told: "You're joking."She turned to the internet after becoming suspicious about the story, which has gripped the world's attention, and she admitted that her scepticism had paid dividends.The woman told the Mirror that the Darwins should be nominated for a "world's dumbest" award."Not only were they photographed, but the date was actually on the picture. I'm a sceptic. Nobody can simply vanish in this day and age. There has to be something, some sign."Mrs Darwin, who sold her home in Seaton Carew, Hartlepool, and moved to Panama about six weeks ago, broke down as she told reporters in the central American republic that her life had become a "nightmare". She confirmed that the picture did show her husband, who was officially declared dead in 2003.
