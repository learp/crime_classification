The parents of a baby boy who died after being abandoned outside a mosque has been arrested in connection with his death, police said today.The 27-year-old woman and her 29-year-old husband were held at an address in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, yesterday.Their arrests come almost three weeks after the baby was found on steps outside a mosque in the Shelton area of the city, with a note asking for help to bury him. He died later in hospital.The newborn baby is thought to have lain undiscovered for at least four hours after being placed on the steps of the Islamic centre on 6 March.A postmortem failed to ascertain a cause of death and further tests are under way.Staffordshire police, whose handling of the incident is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), said today that the baby was found in a carrier bag which contained Â£20 and a note which said "Please help bury him" and an Arabic word for thank you.The IPCC has launched an inquiry into the initial police response to the discovery of the baby, who was not taken to hospital until almost an hour after he was found.Chief Inspector Wayne Jones, of Staffordshire police, said: "From the outset of this investigation our primary concern has been to find mum and assess her health and wellbeing and give her the support she requires. These needs will now be met."Once these needs have been addressed, detectives will begin to make sensitive inquiries into how the baby came to be left outside the mosque."He added: "We have made a number of appeals for information regarding this incident and have received a good response from members of the public, with many issues raised and looked into by officers."Thank you to all of those people who have come forward, and also to the media for their help in this inquiry so far."
