The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, today sought to clarify her remarks about feeling unsafe walking the streets of London at night.She told the Radio 4 Today programme she felt "very safe" walking in parts of the capital she knew well but that people should not walk in unfamiliar districts after midnight.In an interview published in the Sunday Times at the weekend, Smith was asked whether she would feel safe walking on her own around Hackney at midnight.She replied: "Well, no, but I don't think I'd ever have done. You know, I would never have done that, at any point during my life." Asked why not, she answered: "Well, I just don't think that's a thing that people do, is it, really?"Her remarks were interepreted as an admission that the streets of London were unsafe and her embarrassment worsened when - in an attempt to undo the damage - an aide insisted Ms Smith had in fact recently bought a kebab on the streets of Peckham.Today Ms Smith claimed the streets of London were "safer now than they have been at any point".She went on: "I actually feel very safe, as should others in London, because of the work that's been done."What I said was that I feel very safe walking around my part of London and where I live in the West Midlands, but actually I think most people - and it would be the official advice - probably wouldn't walk somewhere, at midnight, that they didn't know. That's a sensible answer isn't it?She added: "Hackney unfortunately has got a bad name out of this. In Hackney crime has come down by 30% because of the work the local council and others have done."Our streets are safer, whether in London or anywhere else, and people should feel confident about walking on them."
