Hark! Is that a gaggle of cherubic little angels singing at your door? Rather than offer young carol singers a mince pie or a shiny penny, you should enforce a silent night by making a citizen's arrest, detaining the little rascals and calling the cops, according to police in Greenwich, southeast London.Officers have been accused of playing Scrooge after issuing stern advice to homeowners who feel intimidated by knocks on their doors after dark from seasonal singers. Greenwich police said singing without a permit or an official charity collection box was begging, reminding residents that begging by children under 16 is an offence. They advised people they could detain young singers and call the police. "Don't be intimidated and don't give them a penny," the police said in a statement.Church and youth leaders in the area said the response would discourage traditional Christmas celebrations. "I can understand where the police are coming from with the vulnerable and the elderly but it does seem a sledgehammer to crack a nut to suggest making a citizen's arrest," said the Rev Elaine Cranmer, of St Luke's church, Eltham. "The original carol singers were beggars and wandering minstrels themselves, before carols were sung in church." The police later retracted their advice. "We were not having a pop at carol singers," said a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police. "What we were trying to do was give out guidance at this time of year about bogus callers." In a revised statement, they said: "We are not seeking to discourage children who want to take part in carol singing but to respect those who do not wish to open their doors and ask others to do so."
