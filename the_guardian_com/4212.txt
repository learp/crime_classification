A music teacher who killed his partner and crammed her body into a suitcase has been accused of constructing an elaborate lie to justify the attack.Andrew Lindo, 28, was described in court as leading a double life involving deceit which made him "an inveterate and accomplished liar" determined to escape a murder charge.He has admitted the manslaughter of Marie Stewart, 30, who had broken her marriage to live with him and become the mother of their two children. But he claims that the bludgeoning and stabbing in December last year was the only way to protect the couple's four-year-old daughter from her mother's abusive behaviour."The defendant accepts that he is responsible for killing but not murdering Marie Stewart," Michelle Colborne QC told Bradford Crown court. "He contends that he was a faithful, loving partner, enduring protracted emotional and physical abuse over a period of years at the hands of the deceased."He alleges that he was forced to kill her to protect their child. So overcome was he by that need and his pent-up emotion that he lost his self control."But the evidence will show instead that he was, and is, an inveterate and accomplished liar, living a double life and setting out a defence which is untruthful. It also creates a wholly misleading impression both of his own character and that of the deceased."Colborne said that the killing had been "protracted and brutal", and that Lindo had then left the body in a suitcase in the family's garage in Holmfirth, near Huddersfield, where it lay undiscovered for two months.Lindo sat beside a security officer in the dock wearing a suit and tie as his alleged deception was detailed. Colborne told the court: "After killing her and dumping her body in the suitcase, he travelled to Barnsley to collect his lover, a lady called Angela Rylance, who had been invited to stay at the house."The killing took place on 18 December but the alarm was not raised until after Christmas when Stewart's family became concerned. Her body was found on 13 February this year.The court heard that Stewart met Lindo, who was originally from the north-east of England, when both were studying at Huddersfield university.Colborne said: "She was married but fell in love with the defendant and gave up everything to be with him, telling a friend that she was the happiest she had ever been."Lindo got a job in Brighouse, near Huddersfield, before moving to work as a music teacher in the Take Two Academy in Barnsley. He and Stewart had a daughter in 2007 and a son last year.The case continues.
