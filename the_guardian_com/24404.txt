Lawyers for the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) are seeking an order preventing one of Britain's most notorious drug dealers from using telephone boxes and having more than one bank account.The high court will hear an application on Friday to impose restrictions on Curtis Warren, 49, a former Liverpool night club bouncer who is scheduled to be released from Belmarsh prison in January.Warren, alleged to have earned more than £200m through his criminal empire, is the only drug trafficker to make it on to the Sunday Times Rich List.The attempt to obtain a serious crime prevention order against him is being taken by an unusual legal route. SCPOs are normally granted by the crown court following conviction.Because Warren was convicted in Jersey of importing cannabis in 2009, outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales, a separate application has to be made in the high court in London. Between 1997 and 2007 Warren was locked up in the Netherlands' highest security jail after being found guilty of conspiring to import £100m worth of cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and cannabis, as well as firearms offences. His sentence was extended after he killed a fellow prisoner in a fight and was convicted of manslaughter.Five weeks after being released he was arrested by Jersey police and accused of being the ringleader of a six-man gang who were trying to import 180kg of cannabis into the island from the Netherlands via a boat from France.More than a hundred SCPOs and orders restricting travel or financial reporting are currently being enforced by Soca. The draft order on Warren, to be submitted to the high court, would come into force when he is released.If accepted by the court, it will stop him using more than one mobile phone or bank account and prevent him from making calls from telephone boxes or kiosks. He will also not be allowed to hold more than £1,000 in cash.In the past Warren was known to have used telephone boxes to avoid his mobile being monitored. The restrictions usually last for five years; Warren would be liable to a maximum of five years in prison if he breached any of them.His lawyers are expected to attend court to oppose the restrictions on the grounds that they are excessive. SCPOs are intended to prevent re-offending rather than serving as a further punishment.Soca described Warren as a "notorious drug dealer". Two years ago he failed to overturn his Jersey conviction on the grounds that police had obtained evidence against him illegally by bugging a car.
