There was nothing "even slightly sinister" about the payments totalling £189,000 that the former Portsmouth owner Milan Mandaric made to Harry Redknapp, the jury in the two men's tax evasion trial has heard.Mandaric's barrister, Lord Ken Macdonald QC, told Southwark crown court the prosecution was "really flailing" with "paper-thin" suggestions that his client had paid the money into Redknapp's Monaco account to avoid tax.He said it was "really desperate stuff" for the prosecution to claim the two payments at the heart of the case were intended as bonuses for the sale of Peter Crouch to Aston Villa or as a reward for Portsmouth beating Manchester United."We say the evidence against [Mandaric] is hopelessly weak," Macdonald said. "There's nothing even slightly sinister" about the money, which, he said, had been paid to provide Redknapp with investment opportunities."In Milan Mandaric's mind this was not money for Crouch, this was Milan Mandaric coming through on money he had promised months before, for a portfolio," the barrister said. As a "non-dom", it made no sense for Mandaric to pay the money into a UK account, the jury heard.Lord Macdonald compared the two men to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in the film The Odd Couple, saying they shared an "emotional relationship, at times a tempestuous relationship, at times a love-hate relationship".He added: "An odd couple, different men, different backgrounds … but I would suggest a deep affection. Mr Mandaric had no fear describing his emotions towards Mr Redknapp, he said he loves [him]."Redknapp, 64, of Poole, Dorset, and Mandaric, 73, of Oadby, Leicestershire, deny two counts of cheating the public revenue when Redknapp was manager of Portsmouth football club.The first charge of cheating the public revenue alleges that between 1 April 2002 and 28 November 2007 Mandaric paid $145,000 (£93,100) into the account. The second charge for the same offence relates to a sum of $150,000 (£96,300) allegedly paid between 1 May 2004 and 28 November 2007.
