A 16-year-old boy was shot dead in Manchester as he was pursued out of a pub car park â€“ the first fatal shooting in the city for more than a year, police said today.Giuseppe Gregory, who lived with his mother in Ardwick, was hit in the head when shots were fired into the back of a green VW Golf in the car park of the Robin Hood pub in Stretford on Sunday night as the vehicle was driving away. Detectives believe the gunmen, who opened fire shortly before 11.50pm, may have been driven to the scene in a taxi.Three of the teenager's friends drove him to Trafford general hospital, but he died at 2.30am. Detectives are treating the incident as gang-related, although it is understood the victim's family insist he was not a gang member.However, he was known to police and known to associate with gang members. Yesterday it emerged that the teenager had been shot in the leg when he was 13 outside the Apollo Theatre in Ardwick.Police are said to be frustrated that two of Giuseppe's friends, who were with him in the Golf, are refusing to help with the investigation into his murder, although one of the friends is co-operating.It is the first fatal gang-related shooting in Greater Manchester in 16 months. Police have hailed a 92% reduction in firearms incidents after a drive to combat gun crime.One line of inquiry is that the teenager and his friends were shot at after he ventured into "enemy" territory and that the shooting may involve a drug deal that went wrong.Three men, aged 18, 20 and 22, were arrested on suspicion of murder but the younger two were released and are being treated as witnesses.
