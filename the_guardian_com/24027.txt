A survivor of the Paddington train crash who claims the ordeal turned him into a killer today launched a legal bid for Â£300,000 in compensation.Four years ago Kerrie Gray pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of John Boultwood in August 2001, on the basis of diminished responsibility.Gray, 47, of Tilbury, Essex, is currently being held in a secure hospital. He is not expected to be released before July next year.He had stabbed Boultwood after the 42-year-old walked in front of his car and banged on the windscreen.Gray's counsel today told the high court in London that Gray would never have killed the victim had it not been for the rail crash in October 1999, which claimed 31 lives. The accident left Gray suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Acting for Mr Gray, Anthony Scrivener said that Gray was entitled to be compensated for losses caused by the admitted negligence of Thames Trains Ltd and Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd."His conviction for manslaughter was a consequence of the accident, and of the defendants' negligence," said Mr Scrivener.Gray, 47, who was of previous good character and had been in continuous employment in a variety of jobs in administration or sales, claims he will have very limited prospects on his release. He is seeking damages for past and future loss of earnings.The rail companies claim that he is not entitled to any compensation on the legal principle of ex turpe causa - meaning that a right of action does not arise out of an evil cause.Mr Scrivener said that Gray lived a "normal and uneventful life" before the accident and had been known for avoiding confrontation. But he then found himself lying amongst broken glass and bodies in the crash, which happened on his way to work in Slough, he began to develop symptoms of PTSD.He suffered a significant personality change, beginning to have angry outbursts, became increasingly socially withdrawn and shunned physical contact.His efforts to stay employed were hampered by the need to use public transport, which sometimes led to episodes of incontinence because of fear.In the week before he was faced with the situation with Mr Boultwood and was "driven to act in the way he did", Gray was off work because of his psychiatric condition and heavy drinking.Gray had just started treatment with a psychologist at the time of the offence.
