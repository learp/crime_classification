The husband of a pregnant woman seriously injured when her car exploded in a suspected bomb attack in Kent was being questioned today on suspicion of her attempted murder, it was reported.Nicholas Fabian, 32, was held after Victoria Fabian, believed to be 32, was hurt in the blast in a communal car park in the village of Vigo, near Meopham, Kent, just after 1pm yesterday, according to Press Association sources.Fabian was in a serious but not life threatening condition in Darent Valley hospital, in Dartford, as detectives questioned her husband. Police said she was the sole occupant of the car when it exploded."I ran out of the house and as I opened the door I saw the car on fire with the front completely blown off. It had disintegrated," said one witness."Her husband and my other neighbour ran towards the car and dragged the woman on to the pavement. I called the emergency services while the two others were trying to calm the woman down on the pavement. She was in a bad way."The witness said the woman suffered serious injuries to her legs and neighbours used T-shirts and towels to stem the bleeding.Another witness, Frances Sentance, 50, a school meals assistant at the local primary school, said: "I was sitting in my kitchen when I heard a huge bang. I ran outside to see what was happening and there was smoke billowing from the wreckage and rising over the trees."Within 10 minutes, the area was flooded with fire engines, ambulances and police. An air ambulance also landed. We're all shocked. It is horrific."A cordon was put in place and three nearby roads closed off, and residents within the cordon area were evacuated to the village hall. A bomb disposal team was sent in as a precautionary measure before the police could begin a full forensic examination of the scene.
