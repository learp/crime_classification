Police in Portugal today reinterviewed two witnesses over the disappearance of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, as the girl's parents prayed for her safe return.The witnesses are believed to be Michaela Walczuch, the German lover of the sole suspect Robert Murat, and her estranged Portuguese husband, Luis Antonio. A senior police source described the questioning as "normal and routine".Madeleine's parents made a pilgrimage to Portugal's holiest shrine to pray for their daughter's safe return.During the emotional visit, Kate and Gerry McCann were hugged and kissed by Catholics at the Fatima shrine.As they approached the main sanctuary, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in 1917, the couple made their way through a crowd of onlookers.They slipped into the back of a Spanish language mass in a covered area in front of the Chapel of Apparitions.As they made their way towards the side chapel for private prayer, one man stopped them to say: "We are all praying for you."Pushing a wheeled walking frame covered in an Irish flag and a card reading "Ireland prays for Madeleine", 71-year-old Anne McManus from west Belfast clutched Mrs McCann's arm.Yesterday Madeleine's parents said they would travel around Europe to widen the search for their daughter, who went missing in the southern Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on May 3.
