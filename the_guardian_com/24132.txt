Max Clifford showed a teenage model his penis, saying: "Isn't it tiny?" – and then posed as an Italian film director to phone her and heap further criticism on the size of his genitals, a court has heard.The PR guru exposed himself twice in his office in London in 1979 or 1980 after the woman went there for interviews about a film role, she told his indecent assault trial.Giving witness evidence at Southwark crown court in London, she said that at the first interview he exposed himself and held his penis in his hand before criticising its size, describing it as "useless" and asking: "How can I satisfy a woman with this?"He did the same at a second interview, she said.He twice promised the film's Italian director or producer would call her but she told the court when a man with an Italian accent called her he talked about Clifford's penis, criticising its size, and invited her to join in with the abuse. She declined to do so, she said.During the second call she twigged that the Italian accent was false and realised it was Clifford and there was no film, she told the court, so she hung up.She said the experience had been "strange" but she did not walk out when he exposed himself because in those days she "didn't stand up for myself"."Also … back in those times, as a woman, you kind of accepted that sort of behaviour a bit more than you should have," she added.The former model is not one of the complainants in the case.The defence barrister Richard Horwell QC told the woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, that because she described Clifford's penis as tiny, she could not have seen it.He said: "His is an average-sized penis. That shows you cannot have seen it."She replied: "I did notice that it was small."Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges.
