Tony Blair will this week spearhead a new crusade on domestic violence designed to prevent battered wives being driven from their homes on to the streets.The Prime Minister - whose wife Cherie, a trustee of the domestic violence charity Refuge, has long campaigned for greater recognition of the problem - will announce a cash injection to offer women and children a safe place to flee. Figures due to be released this week will reveal the hidden role of domestic violence in driving homelessness. One in six of those needing to be housed by local authorities is fleeing a violent partner, while nearly a quarter of homelessness is linked to the breakdown of a relationship. 'We are challenging the stereotype that homelessness is about tramps living in cardboard boxes - it can just as easily be a woman and children forced to leave their home through fear,' said one Whitehall source. Women's Minister Barbara Roche will make clear that local authorities will be expected to treat domestic violence related cases as a priority for rehousing. Although there are around 400 'safe houses' in Britain, taking more than 55,000 women and children a year, that still represents only a third of the number of places which a landmark select committee report on domestic violence said were necessary more than 20 years ago. Local authorities have already been told to stop using bed-and-breakfast accommodation as a temporary stop-gap for homeless people with children. They are likely to be told that B&Bs should no longer be considered suitable for domestic violence survivors either, whether they have children or not.
