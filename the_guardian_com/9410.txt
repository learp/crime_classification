A registered nurse has been charged with the murders of three elderly residents at the care home she ran with her husband, the Crown Prosecution Service said today. Rachel Baker, 44, who operated Parkfields residential care home in Butleigh, Somerset, will appear before magistrates in Yeovil this afternoon. Baker is charged with the murders of Marion Alder, 79, Lucy Cox, 97, and another pensioner, Francis Hay, between 2006 and 2007. She also faces 11 counts of possession of a controlled drug. Baker and her husband, Leigh, 50, are both charged with carrying out acts tending and intending to pervert the course of public justice. Brian Pixton, of the CPS complex casework unit, said: "We have been working closely with the police and medical experts over the past 18 months to investigate all aspects of the care of the individuals concerned before reaching a final decision on charging. We have also sought advice from leading counsel. Accordingly, we have this week authorised the police to charge Mr and Mrs Baker." The senior investigating officer, Detective Superintendent Trevor Simpson, said: "This has been a complex, thorough and necessarily lengthy investigation to bring us to this point. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those affected, the communities in Somerset and especially the families of the bereaved for their understanding, tolerance and patience." The couple, who managed the home for nine years, live in nearby Glastonbury with their young daughter. The Commission for Social Care Inspection obtained a court order to close Parkfields on 16 March and the remaining residents were rehoused. The private home accommodated up to 20 elderly residents in flats and bungalows.
