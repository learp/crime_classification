A father killed his son and may have suffocated his daughter before stabbing himself and setting fire to his house, an inquest heard today.Chef Iain Varma was left heartbroken after his wife Alison left the couple's Devon home and asked for a divorce, the hearing was told.The inquest at Barnstaple heard that Varma's seven-year-old son, Zak, locked himself in the bathroom as he tried to escape his father.He was found alive in the remains of the house having survived a knife attack and an attempt to strangle him but later died of smoke inhalation.North Devon coroner Elizabeth Earland ruled that Varma had unlawfully killed Zak. She recorded an open verdict on Varma's four-year-old daughter, Chloe, who also died in the tragedy, because her body was too badly burnt to determine the cause of her death. Varma, 34, died after stabbing himself twice in the chest.Varma was devastated after his wife began a relationship with local builder Stephen King.The inquest was told that in June 2007 Varma, who once worked at an exclusive club in London, locked the doors and downstairs windows and started a fire in the bedroom the two children shared.Zak, who had learning difficulties, fled and locked himself in the bathroom, but Varma broke in and stabbed and strangled him before dumping his body in the bath. Zak was found unconscious in the bathroom surrounded by bloodied handprints but died in hospital.Neighbours tried to smash the front door and windows of the three-bedroom semi-detached house in the quiet town of North Tawton but could not save Varma or the children.The inquest heard that Iain Varma must have caused the fire because the doors were found locked from the inside with the keys still in the lock. His body was found on his bedroom floor with the knife he had used to stab himself.Detective Chief Inspector Stephen Carey, of Devon and Cornwall police, said: "Iain Varma must have been responsible for the deaths of Chloe and Zak before taking his own life."The Varmas' relationship had become "rocky" after he took a job in Salcombe, Devon, and the distance put a strain on their relationship, the inquest heard.Barmaid Alison Varma had "got together" with King six months earlier after he comforted her in a pub as she cried about the breakdown of her marriage.In the weeks leading up to the tragedy, family and friends said Varma had become "highly emotional" and had threatened to kill himself as his marriage broke down. Varma's mother, Linda, thought her son had got over his troubles and had promised to get his life back on track after hitting an "emotional peak".Neighbours told the inquest how they saw thick black smoke billowing from the windows at about 12.30am and tried to beat the door down after realising the children were inside.Home Office pathologist Gyan Fernando gave Varma's cause of death as knife wounds to his chest, but found evidence of smoke inhalation, indicating he was alive at the start of the fire.He could not determine the cause of Chloe's death but said she had not inhaled smoke so must have been dead when the fire took hold.Zak died of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by smoke inhalation, after he survived stabbing, strangulation and asphyxiation.After the hearing, the children's grandmother, Anita Bickle, said: "What happened that terrible night we will never really know."
