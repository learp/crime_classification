It took six years, two police inquiries and three trials costing an estimated Â£16m to bring anyone to justice in the Damilola Taylor case.The two brothers who were finally convicted of manslaughter last year were prime suspects within days of the brutal stabbing, but blood from the 10-year-old was missed when a trainer and jumper belonging to them were examined in 2000.Ricky and Danny Preddie, who were aged 13 and 12 at the time, were dropped from the inquiry because of a lack of forensic evidence, and four other members of their gang were charged the following year instead.They were acquitted in 2002 after the prosecution's star witness, a 14-year-old girl named as Bromley, was labelled a liar by the judge and the case collapsed.There was never any forensic evidence linking them to the crime scene, where Damilola was stabbed with a broken bottle on his way home from the library in Peckham, south London.Two reports into the handling of the case were announced. One review, by the director of public prosecutions, looked at the way the Crown Prosecution Service handled the case. The second, conducted by an oversight panel chaired by Bishop John Sentamu, investigated how the police had dealt with the young witness.Bishop Sentamu's report made a total of 23 recommendations in relation to the police, the criminal justice system and the prison service, while the other report highlighted weaknesses but said the decision to try the case was "the right thing to do".In November 2003, the police announced a review of all evidence using new forensic techniques.It was only when hundreds of items were resubmitted to a private forensic laboratory that spots of Damilola's blood were discovered on the cuff of Ricky Preddie's sweatshirt and on Danny Preddie's trainer.A fibre from the trousers Damilola was wearing when he was attacked was found within the blood spot on the white Reebok shoe.Another speck of his blood was discovered on the cuff of the sweatshirt.Three government scientists missed the evidence in 2000. But an inquiry today concluded the scientists' mistakes were "extremely regrettable human errors" not systemic failures.The Preddie brothers were rearrested in 2005 and charged with murder.But there was yet another setback in April last year, when a jury cleared them on those counts and failed to reach a verdict on manslaughter charges.The court had heard there had been "serious quality failures" in the examinations carried out by the government's Forensic Science Service.In August the crown pursued a third trial on manslaughter charges alone and the Old Bailey jury took six hours and 20 minutes to find them guilty.At the time, Commander Dave Johnston of the Metropolitan police specialist crime directorate said he was dismayed that crucial evidence in the case was not found sooner."Clearly the forensic evidence was particularly involved in bringing justice and had it been found sooner we would have seen this played out a lot quicker," he said.
