The parents of one of two prostitutes found dead in a stream described yesterday how their daughter turned from a piano-playing schoolgirl into a drug addict who sold sex on the streets of Ipswich.The body of 25-year-old Gemma Adams was found in a brook near the Suffolk town last weekend, and the remains of her friend and fellow prostitute, 19-year-old Tania Nicol, were discovered about a mile away last Friday. Both had vanished from Ipswich's red-light area. Police say the two women's deaths may have been the work of the same attacker. Officers are checking similar cases in East Anglia to establish whether a serial killer could be at large, but stressed no link had been found to any other crime.Yesterday Ms Adams's parents talked of their horror at learning first that their daughter was dead and also that she was a prostitute. 'We are going through hell trying to come to terms with it. It has been shock after shock', said her father, a businessman. 'We never knew she was working as a prostitute until she went missing. It is just every parent's nightmare.'Speaking on condition that their first names were not used, the dead woman's father detailed their fruitless attempts to get her off drugs and increasing estrangement from their troubled daughter. 'One of her teachers described her as an "ordinary, intelligent girl from a nice family" and that's exactly what she was', said her father. But she got into the 'wrong crowd' after leaving Kesgrave High School near Ipswich and before long had become addicted to heroin and crack cocaine.She was last seen around 1.15am on 15 November in the red-light area around Ipswich Town's Portman Road ground. Her boyfriend Jon Simpson, a fellow addict, reported her missing. She was found naked in a brook at Hintlesham, Suffolk, on 2 December.Tania Nicol disappeared from the same area on 30 October. Her body was found by police divers 48 hours ago.
