Two men were arrested today in connection with the murder of 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi, police said.The men, aged 39 and 35, were arrested in the Broadway area of Roath, Cardiff, and are in custody, South Wales police said.Siddiqi was fatally stabbed in front of his parents by masked men who burst into his home in Cardiff on Sunday afternoon. Police believe the murder may have been a case of mistaken identity. His parents, aged 55 and 68, were also stabbed as they rushed to help their son during the attack. Both suffered serious wounds to the torso but have been released from hospital.Detective Chief Superintendent Stuart McKenzie today said: "Aamir's family were immediately informed of this development and we continue to support and update them. Despite these arrests we are still appealing for information. I urge anyone who has information to contact the incident room at Cardiff central police station on 02920 571530 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111."Chief superintendent Bob Tooby, divisional commander for Cardiff, added: "This is a significant development in our enquiry and I would like to thank everyone who has responded to our appeals for information so far."At a press conference on Tuesday, Nishat Siddiqi, 34, one of the teenager's three sisters, appealed to the public to come forward. She said: "We are afraid in our own family that the people who committed this crime may do so again. If anybody has any information, then they should pass this on to the police. Please help so that these perpetrators are found before they harm anyone else."In a statement released after his death, the family described the victim as "a kind and sensitive gentleman".Police today widened their search for the murderers by using Facebook to appeal for witnesses, and putting a recording of the family's press conference and appeal on YouTube.
