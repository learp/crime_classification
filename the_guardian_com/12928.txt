An African pensioner whose house was targeted by racists in a paint bomb attack over the weekend is moving out of his home.The 65-year-old Ghanian said he felt “threatened and I want to get out” after his house was covered in paint during what the police service of Northern Ireland are treating as a hate crime incident.On Sunday Adu Kyeremateng said he no longer felt safe at his home in Townsend Terrace in the loyalist Shankill area.“I can’t go on like that. I haven’t done anything to anybody and I don’t have conflict with anybody. I have a right to live in peace without being threatened by anybody so I’m going to see houses I could live in tomorrow. I just don’t want to risk it,” he said.He added that he did not know why he had been singled out for attack.“I live here peacefully,” he said.“I don’t see why people would do such a thing in the 21st century. People must have the right to live anywhere they want, and people have the right to live in peace without resistance from others.”The majority of a rising number of racist attacks in Northern Ireland have taken place in loyalist areas, mainly in Greater Belfast.Last June the annual benchmark report on human rights and racial equality by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities, revealed that there were 982 racist incidents in 2013-14 compared with 750 incidents the previous year.It noted that over the past five years 75% of all complaints to the equality commission in Northern Ireland about harassment in offices, shops or factories were related to racial abuse and intimidation.Over the past year Northern Ireland has become one of the worst spots for racist crimes and race hate-linked incidents in the UK, but the authors of the report say the region is home to only 1% of all the non-EU/EEA migrants who have come into the UK.
