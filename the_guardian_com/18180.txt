A teenager has been jailed for a minimum of nine years and three months after starting a fire that killed twin sisters and their two brothers.Holly and Ella Smith, who were four, and their two-year-old brother Jordan were asleep as the blaze took hold at the house in Freckleton, Lancashire, while elder brother Reece, 19, was overcome by fumes when he went upstairs to try to rescue them.All four died from the effects of smoke inhalation caused by the fire on 7 January last year.In July, Dyson Allen, 19, was convicted of four counts of manslaughter by a jury at Preston crown court that found he had set fire to a bedroom wardrobe. Allen, a heavy cannabis user, had spent the day drinking vodka and smoking cannabis from a bong.Sentencing him to life, Mr Justice Males said he had no motive to harm the children or anyone in the Smith family.He said: "So why did you do it? In one sense, what prompted you to do this terrible thing – not only starting a fire in a room where defenceless young children were asleep but waiting for several minutes before raising the alarm – is a mystery."But in another sense, why you did it seems clear enough. It was because you were out of your head due to the lethal combination of alcohol and cannabis which you had taken that day and because of your fascination with fire, particularly when you are affected by drink or drugs."He said a life term was required because Allen posed a significant risk of harm to the public.Allen – who sobbed throughout the hearing – would be released only when he was no longer deemed a risk, he said.Allen was cleared of murdering the siblings. He denied all the charges and claimed it was not him who had started the fire.
