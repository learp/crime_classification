The prison service is interviewing inmates at Wealstun jail, near Wetherby, West Yorkshire, to find ringleaders of the rooftop protest which ended about 3am yesterday.The last of 20 prisoners came down peacefully from the flat roof of the open jail's C block, after defying warders and negotiators for 31 hours. Some protesters originally wore masks but most were waving at journalists behind a 20ft fence as the demon stration entered into its second day. The protest is thought to have centred on changes in the exercise routine, caused by building work, and the arrival of inmates from Manchester and Liverpool jails. The men broke windows and climbed drainpipes at 8pm on Monday. The prison service said little damage had been caused. The first two prisoners were lifted down on Tuesday after signalling that they had had enough. Others gave themselves up in small groups, with the final six giving in at 3am.
