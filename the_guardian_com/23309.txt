A woman who was killed by her estranged husband repeatedly raised fears with police about his flouting of court orders in the months before her death.Anne-Marie Birch, 47, was strangled to death by 55-year-old Lee Birch while dog-walking in a field near her home in Ramsgate, Kent, in November 2013.Between September 2013 and the morning of her killing, Anne-Marie had contacted police nine times over her concerns about the behaviour of her husband of more than 20 years.In one exchange, she told officers she had been warned to “sleep with one eye open”, and that Birch had threatened to stab her through her heart but was told: “You don’t have a heart”. On another occasion, Birch stood outside a restaurant peering in as Anne-Marie, who ran a dog walking firm, dined with friends and her mother.She also revealed to police that he told her he hoped she would die of cancer and that he wanted her to “die screaming”.A report published by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Birch repeatedly flouted both a restraining and non-molestation order.The report detailed a conversation Anne-Marie had with police a month before she was killed. She said: “I got the order against him, you know, it’s with a power of arrest, but they said any, any time he contacts you, to phone and we’ll get him arrested, but it’s just not happening, there’s nothing happening, you know.”Unbeknown to the call handler or Anne-Marie, Birch had earlier been arrested while parked in a pub car park and charged with breaching his non-molestation order.But he carried on contacting her. Days before he killed her, Birch called police to report that he was stalking her, and had asked her if she was in a new relationship. Her final call to police came on the morning of her death to a trainee call handler, when she reported being frightened at suddenly seeing her estranged husband in the garden.The report said Anne-Marie considered it the “last straw” and said Birch needed to be arrested. But important details of what she said were not accurately reflected on the record, it added.Some “significant omissions” were made, including her concerns about Birch following and watching her while dog walking, IPCC investigators noted.That call was made at 8.32am. At 2.04pm a member of the public called police to report the discovery of a body in a field that was later identified as Anne-Marie.Lee Birch was jailed for life for the killing in April 2014.In its report, the IPCC said several of Anne-Marie’s calls to police could have been handled better. Problems included incorrect logging of calls and a lack of awareness among some call centre staff about non-molestation orders.Some officers who spoke to her before she obtained a non-molestation order may have failed to identify potential offences by Birch, including threats to kill.The IPCC said the failings by officers may have resulted in unsatisfactory performance procedures being brought against them. But Kent police has addressed issues through “formal learning” and accepted 12 recommendations by the police watchdog.Eight officers and three call centre workers should receive learning to prevent a repeat of the mistakes, IPCC commissioner Mary Cunneen said.Kent police said some aspects of how they handled Anne-Marie’s contact made for “disappointing reading”. The force said: “We aim to put victims at the heart of everything we do and clearly there were steps we could have taken to improve the service Anne-Marie received when she had concerns about her estranged husband’s behaviour.“As soon as it became clear there were areas needing improvement, those improvements were made and they have been in place for a significant period of time. “We have agreed with the IPCC that eight officers and three force control room workers should receive some bespoke training to ensure we continue to provide a first-class service to the people of Kent. “While Kent police recognises it could have offered a better service to Anne-Marie, it became clear in our investigation that her estranged husband had a very determined and clear intention to do her serious harm.”
