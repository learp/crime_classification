One of the five men questioned by police over the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence has been sentenced to 50 hours' community service for possessing an illegal weapon.Neil Stuart, who has changed his name from Acourt by deed poll, was stopped by police, who found a police baton - similar to that used in martial arts - on June 14 last year. He admitted the offence at Canterbury crown court, and was ordered to pay Â£100 costs by recorder David Mitchell. Stuart, 25, of Greenwich, south London, had appeared in Folkestone magistrates court in Kent on the day he was stopped, charged with smuggling illegal immigrants. He was cleared of the charge on Monday. Stuart was caught by police speeding at 45mph in a 30mph zone in a hire car half a mile from the court. He appeared before the magistrates that afternoon charged with possessing an extendible ABS police baton, which officers had found in the car. Nigel Van Der Bijl, prosecuting, said yesterday that Stuart had told police the baton was used to defend himself. In a statement to police he said: "The baton was there to protect myself and to hit people. It was there for self-defence." But Stuart insisted he had not needed to use the weapon on any occasion, although he was concerned about repercussions from the publicity of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.
