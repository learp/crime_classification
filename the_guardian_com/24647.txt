Thousands of pounds worth of jewellery has been stolen from a luxury shopping arcade in London's financial district.The robbers used sledgehammers to smash open display cases at jewellers De Beers and Swiss watchmakers Omega in the Royal Exchange shopping centre in the City of London.Police are now sifting through CCTV footage in a bid to identify the thieves, who struck at 10pm on Saturday night, and trace their getaway car, a red BMW.The senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Steven Chandler, said: "We are currently following a number of lines of inquiry and I can reassure the public that every effort is and will be directed to bringing those responsible to justice."We need the assistance of the public in tracing the car used, the criminals involved and the items stolen."A security guard at the shopping centre, who did not want to be named, said: "We've been told that at about 10pm [on Saturday] night a BMW turned up at the back entrance, four men jumped out and managed to get inside the building somehow."At the moment we don't know how much has been taken, but with the price of some of the stuff inside these shops just a few items could easily run up to a very, very large amount."It's looking as though whoever has done this has been targeting the shops for a long time."A police spokesman said: "Shortly after 10pm, a group of suspects gained entry to De Beers and Omega and made off with luxury jewellery with an unspecified value.The upmarket arcade lies just yards from the Bank of England and houses more than 30 luxury stores.
