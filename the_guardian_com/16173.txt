British Airways and four other companies are to "twin" with jails in a revolutionary scheme to inject private sector skills and experience into the Prison Service.Rod Eddington, the BA chief executive, said he had felt compelled to act after being shocked by a visit to Feltham prison and young offenders institute near Heathrow. "Unless large organisations like ours are prepared to help its difficult to see how people in prisons who want to build conventional lives can do so."Mr Eddington will coach the governor of Feltham and expects to bring in senior airline managers to help mentor other managers at the institute. The Prison Service, which supports the scheme, hopes firms will help with IT services and with training or job opportunities for ex-offenders.Others involved in the project organised by Business in the Community (BITC) include Centrica which is linked with Wormwood Scrubs, Accenture (Holloway), Marsh (Wandsworth) and Guardian Newspapers (Pentonville). All the prisons are in London. Executives have been stung into action after a "Seeing is Believing" tour of Feltham last spring aimed at jolting them out of any complacency and encouraging them to help tackle some of Britain's social ills.Mr Eddington dismissed suggestions that the companies might seek to influence prison policy or hope to gain commercially. "I am not charging in there as an outsider on a white horse and neither am I giving away shareholders money. I am giving my personal time and energy to this in the way that many individual airline staff have helped with charities and schools in many parts of the world."He admitted that if something went drastically wrong at a prison the companies' brands could be hit but this had to be a risk worth taking. "If you looked at it in that way you would never do anything. Society cannot afford to give up on huge issues such as these."Phil Wheatley, director general of the Prison Service, said he had learned from a pilot project at Wandsworth prison that there was a surprising amount in common between running a prison and managing a public company.
