An unemployed labourer has admitted that he made the "I'm Jack" tape and hoax letters that derailed the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe.John Humble, 50, of Sunderland, who is charged with perverting the course of justice, was remanded in custody until March 20. The strong Wearside accent on the tapes diverted police attention to the Sunderland area.David Taylor, for Humble, told Leeds crown court yesterday: "The defence concedes that he wrote the letters and in fact made the tape. The issue now is not one of whether it actually was him, it is solely the question of intent."
