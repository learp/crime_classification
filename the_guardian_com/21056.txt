The great train robber Ronnie Biggs has been given permission to challenge the decision to refuse him parole, his legal adviser said today.The justice secretary, Jack Straw, refused to release the 79-year-old from prison earlier this month on the grounds that he was "wholly unrepentant" about his crimes.But Biggs's legal adviser, Giovanni di Stefano, said the high court had granted his client permission for a judicial review of the decision."I am very pleased and proud to confirm that the high court of justice have granted us leave and permission to challenge the decision of Jack Straw MP refusing to accept the decision of the parole board to release Ronnie Biggs," he said.Biggs, who will be 80 next week, is in hospital suffering from severe pneumonia.Earlier today, his family renewed their appeal for his release from prison on compassionate grounds. They wrote to Straw urging him to end "further procrastination" as Biggs's life hangs in the balance.Doctors caring for Biggs at Norfolk and Norwich University hospital have said he has "little hope of recovery".They have agreed with his son Michael that he will not be resuscitated if his heart stops. Biggs was transferred from Norwich prison to the hospital on Tuesday.In recent years he has suffered a series of strokes, leaving him unable to eat, speak or walk. He is fed through a tube and communicates by pointing at letters on a card.His legal representatives asked the government to consider releasing him on compassionate grounds and prison service officials have been looking at the request.Dr Helen May, who is responsible for Biggs's care, said he "remains frail and in poor condition" although he was a "little brighter" yesterday.In a letter about his condition, she said: "On July 28 Mr Biggs was unresponsive and unable to communicate. I spoke to Michael Biggs, his son, and discussed his father's condition."I stated there was little hope of recovery due to his father's frailty and poor nutritional status."Biggs, from Lambeth, south London, was one of 15 in a gang that attacked the Glasgow to London mail train at Ledburn, Buckinghamshire, in August 1963 and made off with Â£2.6m in used banknotes.He was given a 30-year sentence but after 15 months escaped from Wandsworth prison in south-west London by climbing a 10-metre wall and fleeing in a furniture van.Biggs was on the run for more than 30 years, living in Australia and Brazil, before returning to the UK voluntarily in 2001 in search of medical treatment.He was put in Belmarsh high-security prison on his return before being moved to a specialist medical unit at Norwich prison.Earlier requests for release on compassionate grounds were refused in 2006, 2007 and last month.The prison service said a request had been received and would be dealt with as soon as possible.A spokesman said: "We can confirm that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich has been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service."All applications are processed as soon as we reasonably can and each is carefully considered on its merits against the published criteria."
