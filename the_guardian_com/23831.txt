A Spanish man involved in rioting in Belfast has apologised to the policewoman he injured in the violence.Rodger Jarro Costa, 29, who lives in south Belfast, pleaded guilty at the city's crown court to causing grievous bodily harm and a rioting offence during the trouble outside the Ardoyne shops in north Belfast on 12 July last year.At the prompting of the recorder Tom Burgess, Costa turned to the PSNI constable and said he was sorry for causing her injuries. The woman was one of 48 police officers injured during three nights of violence.A previous court hearing heard her say in a statement: "I felt incredible force hit me on the back of the head and shoulders. I remember the horrifying sound I made as I fell. The pain to my neck and back was instant and excruciating."Two other men pleaded guilty on Tuesday to offences connected to the riot. In total 26 men arrested over the disturbances have pleaded guilty, and the judge said he would sentence all 26 over the course of two days next month.
