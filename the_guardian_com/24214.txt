The house where a pit bull terrier mauled to death a five-year-old girl was "awash with blood" after the attack, police said today.Officers were called to the home of Ellie Lawrenson's grandmother after the dog, "barking and baring its teeth", set upon the girl, Liverpool crown court heard.Jacqueline Simpson, 45, who is due to give evidence later this afternoon, denies committing manslaughter by failing to take proper care of her granddaughter.Tests showed she had taken drugs and alcohol on the day of the killing, the jury heard.In a statement, Sergeant Paul Hudson, one of the first at the scene at the house in St Helens, Merseyside, described seeing the dog's chest "red with blood"."The living room floor was laminated and awash with blood," he said. "It was as though it had been washed with blood."Jacqueline Simpson wasn't making much sense, and I could smell alcohol on her breath."It is difficult to say whether she can be described as drunk, given her injuries and distress, but she had clearly had a drink."I heard the dog in the garden and was concerned for our safety if it got in."It appeared frenzied, barking and baring its teeth at me. I was worried that it could run at the window and easily break the glass."Earlier today, the court heard how Simpson, who smoked up to 10 cannabis joints a day, had been nearly twice over the legal limit for drinking and driving.She had in her system about 140 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The legal drink-drive limit is 80 milligrams. She had also taken sleeping tablets and was on medication for depression, a jury was told.Brian Johnson, a chartered chemist, forensic scientist and toxicology specialist, said: "For a level of 140, one can talk in general terms of an average individual who drinks on a social basis. One might expect symptoms such as the beginning of slurring of speech, and balance would be affected. Coordination would be impaired."Mr Johnson said the various substances, taken together, would enhance feelings of euphoria, relaxation and intoxication.Speaking about the defendant's sleeping tablets, Temazepam, he said: "It is my opinion the intoxication experienced from the alcohol, combined with that from the cannabis, would be further exacerbated by the presence of Temazepam."The degree of intoxication, I can't comment on, because of the tolerance of the individual, and that is unknown in this particular case."Kai Farmer, a trainee paramedic, told how he had covered Ellie's body with a blanket soon after he arrived at the house. Describing what he saw as he opened the front door, he said: "Jacqui was lying down in almost a foetal position on the kitchen floor against the cupboard doors."She was absolutely covered in blood and told me her name was Jacqui."She had some obvious injuries to her right arm. The most obvious was a deep laceration, which started on either side of her elbow."Simpson had been frightened as she left the house to get to the ambulance, as this meant walking past her granddaughter's covered body, he said.Recalling her words to him in the ambulance, he said: "The dog wandered over, wagging his tail, and all of a sudden went for Ellie, and there was nothing she could do to stop him."Mr Farmer said the defendant had repeatedly asked: "Why would a dog do something like that?"PC Wilfred McGinnis, who killed the dog, named Reuben, with a shotgun, told the court he had taken up a position behind a gate and fired one cartridge into the dog's head from a distance of 30cm (12in). The trial continues.
