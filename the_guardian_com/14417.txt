A paedophile caught out by the freckles on his hands in a case said to be the first of its kind was jailed today.Father-of-one, Dean Hardy, 50, took photographs of young Thai girls being sexually abused during a business trip to the country.He was careful not to include his face in the photographs but police noticed a male hand touching the girls in some of the pictures.The furniture salesman from Orpington, Kent, was jailed at Southwark crown court in central London after admitting two counts of indecent assault of a girl under the age of 13, four counts of taking indecent photographs of children during March and April 2004 and one count of possessing indecent photographs.He made no visible reaction as he was given a six-year sentence.Judge Gregory Stone, sentencing, said: "It's plain from the evidence that you went to Thailand where you molested young girls and took photographs, indecent photographs, of these young female children."As many as four children were involved in these crimes. This was sex tourism of the most offensive kind."You were plainly exploiting their and their families' poverty and vulnerability without caring what harm you were inflicting on these children, and caring only for your own depraved gratification."The photographs were discovered when police acting on intelligence searched his home and discovered images on memory cards from two cameras and the hard drive of a computer.Two of the 63 indecent photographs found on the memory cards showed young South-East Asian girls – between the ages of eight and 10 – being abused by an adult.A forensic anthropologist compared the freckles and blemishes on the hand in the photographs with those on Hardy's left hand and found that they were identical.Police also found he was in Thailand at the time the pictures were taken.Earlier this week Peter Zinner, prosecuting, told the court: "There were some quite striking blemishes and freckles on the hands in the photograph. The decision was taken to compare these pictures with pictures of the hand of Mr Hardy."He said that the technique meant that this case was "the first of its kind because Mr Hardy was subsequently identified".
