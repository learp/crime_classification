What was it about John Dyson that inspired his fellow jurors to chose him as their foreman at a London crown court earlier this month? Was it his clean-cut image? Or was it his natural air of authority?None of the other 11 had any idea of his standing or title. They were unaware that in his day job he is known as Lord Justice Dyson and sits as a senior judge in the court of appeal. Nor did they know that he is the first judge to sit on a jury. Such is the power of English deference, perhaps, that in ignorance they turned to him anyway to represent them. And then they all, Lord Justice Dyson included, acquitted the accused.The idea of a judge serving on a jury was, until recently, seen as ridiculous. It was thought that their inside knowledge of the system would clash with the principle that a defendant must be tried by a jury of his peers. Lawyers, too, were barred, for the same reason.But that was before the government decided to change the law to tackle the "middle class opt-out" from jury service. Not only did a whole raft of professions previously excluded - judges, lawyers, police and others connected with the justice system - become eligible to serve, but it became much harder to escape jury duty by pleading professional or other commitments.Four judges have been summoned for jury duty since May, when the new law came into force, although Lord Justice Dyson had to opt out of a second case because he knew the trial judge.In another case, barrister Andrew Prynne was discharged from a murder jury at the Old Bailey last month after a judge said his knowledge of court procedure would allow him to understand legal matters that other jurors might miss. Judge George Bathurst-Norman said he did not know how the legislation was expected to work, adding: "At the end of the day, I have to ensure a fair trial."
