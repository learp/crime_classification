The families of two women who died after a car hit a group of pedestrians outside a Manchester hospital have paid tribute to them.Clare Haslam, 44, and Deborah Clifton, 49, were both pronounced dead in hospital shortly after the collision at Withington community hospital on Tuesday.Their relatives paid tribute to the couple, who had a young daughter, saying: “They are together in heaven as they were on Earth.”The families of the couple, who lived in in Chorlton, said in a statement: “Clare and Debbie were like an old married couple, they would fight like cat and dog, bicker at the slightest thing but ultimately they were made for each other, so blissfully happy and without doubt soulmates. “Clare was popular and well-liked by many, she was so full of life, but as a young lady she was really lacking in self-confidence until she met Debbie. Her and Debbie became inseparable and did practically everything together including raising their adorable little girl.“We are all so heartbroken and will miss Debbie and Clare every day for the rest of our lives.” An 89-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of two counts of causing deaths by dangerous driving. Police have not yet named the suspect, who has been bailed until 18 April.Sgt Lee Westhead of Greater Manchester police said: “My thoughts are with the families of Clare and Debbie. Our investigation is now under way and I would like to thank the public who have been incredibly helpful.“We are now doing all that we can to piece together how this tragedy could have happened.”
