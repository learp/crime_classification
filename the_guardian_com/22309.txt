The jury of five men and seven women trying the alleged killer of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman was today taken to the Cambridgeshire town to retrace the girls' last steps.Guided by Richard Latham QC, counsel for the prosecution, a group also comprising the trial judge, the defendants' legal team, court officials, police and seven members of the media was taken around what are alleged to be key sites in the double murder case.Travelling in a convoy from London, the group met at Soham Village College, which was closed for the day. Jury members got their first glimpse of 5 College Close, where the girls' alleged killer, Ian Huntley, lived at the time of their disappearance.Mr Huntley is unlikely to deny that the two friends, both aged 10, died while in the two-storey house, the Old Bailey heard last week.Before the trial came to court, the house had been surrounded by green metal cladding in order to protect it from prying eyes and potential vandals. The cladding was removed prior to the jury's visit.Plastic covered the original windows, which Mr Latham told the jury were removed during the police investigation. The house was also stripped of all interior fittings.No descriptions of the interior of the house other than Mr Latham's can be given for legal reasons.He asked the jury to imagine how it had looked at the time of the girls' disappearance, and handed the jurors a bundle of photographs and floor plans of the original layout.The 12 jurors filed into the house at 12.37pm. A court official in charge of overseeing the jury stood at the front door, guarding the entrance.The jurors remained in the house, looking around the three bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, lounge and dining room, until 12.52pm.Mr Latham told the jurors that both the prosecution and defence invited them to consider sightlines from within the house, both upstairs and downstairs.They had previously retraced the exact route that the prosecution alleges the girls took before they entered the building.The jury left the Wells family home, a modern two-storey building in a quiet cul de sac, and walked down onto Sand Street, where they paused so that Mr Latham could point out the entrance to Soham Village College.The group of some 40 people - escorted by four policemen, one at each corner - then walked up Sand Street to the war memorial before doubling back and travelling down Gidney Lane to the Ross Peers Sports Centre. There, they entered the foyer to view the CCTV cameras which captured the last known footage of Holly and Jessica.Inside the sports centre, the CCTV screens showed only the car park. Outside the building, Mr Latham led the group back over to the college, where he took them into College Road to show them the garage of 5 College Close, and then led them back to the house.The streets were virtually deserted, with all traffic stopped and few pedestrians visible in the town.The jurors later saw the hangar building where Mr Huntley is alleged to have dumped the girls' clothing in a bin.Tomorrow, the jurors will be taken to the remote ditch near Lakenheath, Suffolk - a 30-minute drive away - where Mr Huntley, the former caretaker at Soham Village College, is alleged to have dumped the girls' bodies before setting fire to them.Mr Huntley, 29, denies the two counts of murder, but has admitted a single charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.His ex-girlfriend, Maxine Carr, 26, a former classroom assistant at the girls' primary school, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two charges of assisting an offender.She is accused of providing Mr Huntley, with whom she lived at 5 College Close, with a false alibi for the day the girls vanished.The jurors are visiting Soham on the sixth day of the trial, after hearing Mr Latham open the case for the prosecution.Mr Latham alleged that the girls died within hours of going missing on Sunday August 4 last year.
