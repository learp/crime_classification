A pensioner found dead in a chair after a visit by GP Harold Shipman had been as fit as a butcher's dog, a public inquiry heard yesterday.Joseph Bardsley, 83, the second known male victim of Shipman, died at the Bradley Green community centre in Newton in April 1984. The Manchester inquiry into the crimes of Shipman, who was last year convicted of murdering 15 patients, is expected to run for at least two years. John Hopwood, Mr Bardsley's son-in-law, told it: "He was generally as fit as a butcher's dog. Old age had nothing to do with Joe's death, he was far too fit and strong. There was absolutely nothing wrong with him mentally or physically." Edith Hopwood, Mr Bardsley's daughter, said: "I have no idea why Shipman was trying to see Dad, when he had never had any cause to visit him at home before, and especially out of the blue on a Sunday afternoon. At the time I thought how good it was of him, though I have thought differently since." The death of another patient, Fanny Nichols, 84, in 1993 at her home in Hyde was investigated by police but no charges were brought. Muriel Nichols, her daughter-in-law, told the inquiry that police told the family a prescription of morphine had been collected against her name on the day after her death.
