Tony Blair today launches a new war on yobbery with a crackdown on inadequate parents, aimed at tackling even the tiniest tearaways too young to face prosecution.Parents of anti-social under-10s who cannot be taken to court, or of older children who have not yet offended but are deemed at risk, will face orders compelling them to attend behavioural classes or comply with standards in a dramatic widening of the concept of anti-social behaviour.The Prime Minister, who argues today in The Observer that traditional courts are 'too cumbersome' to tackle low-level intimidation and violence, will unveil research showing where tough approaches are used even in their currently limited form they have reduced both fear of anti-social behaviour and incidents of criminal damage.Downing Street's plans to intensify the war on anti-social behaviour could also see Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, lose overall responsibility for the so-called 'respect' agenda, when Blair completes the unfinished Cabinet reshuffle triggered by David Blunkett's resignation.Hazel Blears, now Home Office minister for anti-social behaviour, is tipped for promotion to the Cabinet Office taking her current responsibilities with her. That would enable Blears and the 'respect tsar' Louise Casey to work directly to Blair, cutting out the Home Office - where officials are more cautious about his radical ideas.The government's 'respect' plan, due in January, is expected to define anti-social behaviour as much more than just crime, stressing the need to tackle the root causes of problem behaviour even before laws get broken.It will also reflect warnings from senior police officers about primary school-aged 'teeny tearaways', who are already involved in petty criminal behaviour but cannot be punished because of their age. Children cannot be prosecuted until they are 10.Currently court parenting orders - which require parents of troublesome children to attend parenting lessons, ensure children attend school and obey curfews, on pain of a fine or jail sentence against the parents - only target the parents of older teens who have Asbos or have broken the law.Ministers will argue however that the risk signs of future trouble are evident in much younger children and so their parents should be tackled early. Schools and other organisations will get new powers to seek the orders.'We will see [the agenda] deepened to tackle and prevent problems as early as possible, broadening it across the country and across a wider range of behaviours,' said a government source. 'We are by no means complacent. People still experience much too much anti-social behaviour in many parts of the country.'Critics last night warned the plans risked stigmatising families. 'I really would struggle to know how you could make the definition of anti-social behaviour broader than it already is, which is behaviour likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress,' said Shami Chakrabarti of the civil rights group Liberty. 'Going for younger children before they have actually done anything is positively chilling.'However, writing in the The Observer today, Blair argues that family ties have weakened and communities fractured over the past decades, allowing a new kind of disorder to flourish that the courts have failed to tackle: 'Traditional court processes and laws simply could not and did not protect people against the random violence and low-level disorder that affected their lives.'And he denies that the increasing use of so-called summary powers - allowing police to act without invoking the courts - would infringe civil liberties: 'We are very sensitive to the need to preserve accountability.'
