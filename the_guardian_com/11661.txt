The serial killer Harold Shipman has refused to be interviewed by Greater Manchester police about the suspicious deaths of 100 of his patients.The former doctor from Mottram, near Hyde, was given 15 life sentences in January for murdering 15 women patients. Detective Superintendent Bernard Postles, who led the original murder inquiry, said that Shipman, who is at Frankland prison, County Durham, had refused to co-operate with their investigations. "I am disappointed that he has continued to disregard the feelings of the victims' families," said Mr Postles yesterday. Mr Postles added it was not the end of the investigation and if Shipman decided to admit his involvement a team of officers would be sent to interview him. Shipman's wife, Primrose, and his 17-year-old son have moved from their home in Greater Manchester to Whitby, north Yorkshire, so they can be closer to him.
