Ipswich crown court today heard that Steve Wright had been living in London Road, Ipswich, at the time the women had died.His home, which he had rented with his partner, Pamela Wright, since September 2006, was within the town's red light district and near where the murdered prostitutes had routinely worked. At the time of the killings, Wright had been a forklift truck driver who worked dayshifts while his girlfriend worked nights at a call centre.This gave the 49-year-old the perfect opportunity to commit the murders while his partner was at work, the court was told by Peter Wright, QC, prosecuting."Significantly at the time of the first two murders he [Wright] was working in Hadleigh, an area a little further to the west from where the bodies of Gemma and Tania were found," said the prosecutor."It is the prosecution case, therefore, that whilst his partner Miss Wright was at work and engaged on the nightshift, the defendant was engaged in other activities - namely picking up prostitutes in the red light district of Ipswich and killing them by asphyxiation or manual compression of the neck whilst they were severely affected by opiates."Wright described the defendant as a user of prostitutes who had his own means of transport - a dark blue Ford Mondeo - allowing him to not only pick up the women but also to dispose of their bodies.Because the prostitutes of Ipswich knew him, they were at ease in his company and not suspicious of his motives, the jury was told.
