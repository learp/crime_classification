A convicted murderer has still not been traced three weeks after the foreign prisoners scandal was disclosed, the new home secretary, John Reid, admitted last night.He is among a group of nine foreign prisoners who were convicted of "most serious offences", including manslaughter, rape and child sex offences, who have yet to be tracked down by the authorities after they were released without their deportation being considered.In newly revised figures given to the Commons yesterday by Mr Reid he said the number of serious offenders - defined as armed robbery and worse - freed without being considered for deportation had now risen to 179 from 150 last week.The sacked home secretary, Charles Clarke, put the figure at 79 out of the total of 1,023 released without being considered for removal when he admitted the scale of the scandal three weeks ago.The outdated figures published yesterday disclosed that 57 of the 179 serious offenders have been convicted of fresh crimes after their release - 19 of which involved violence or a sexual element.The official total for the number actually deported remains at only 20 out of the original 1,023 although removal proceedings have now been started in 649 cases."I have widened the definition of serious offences to include all cases where there has been any conviction for offences involving violence or a sexual element. This includes armed robbery," said Mr Reid, explaining the changing figures."As the operation has progressed, detailed examination of the case files and other records has to date identified 179 offenders who had previously been convicted of a serious offence."He said that 35 of the 179 had been originally convicted of the "most serious offences" defined as murder, manslaughter, rape and child sex offences. Three of the four murderers had been traced as had 23 of the 31 other most serious offenders. So far eight of them had been convicted of new crimes since their release but none involved violence or had a sexual element.A Home Office spokeswoman declined to give further details on the untraced murderer. It is believed he is among the initial group identified. He should have been easily contactable by the authorities as he is supposed to have been released on a "life licence" and subject to recall to prison at any time. So far only 55 of the remaining 144 serious offenders have been brought "under the control of the authorities" or deported.Mr Reid said the priority remained dealing with the most serious cases first but he declined to give a timetable for the automatic deportation of those who had served "significant custodial sentences".He said his investigation into the foreign prisoners fiasco was uncovering deep-rooted problems in the criminal justice system which required urgent action.
