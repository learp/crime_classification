If 19-year-old Robert Alexiuk misbehaves in his garden, he faces being sent back to jail. When he is released from a 15-month sentence for theft in May, he is to be served with an anti-social behaviour order, or Asbo.The five-year Asbo bans the Manchester teenager from seeing 10 named people outdoors and in their gardens. He cannot use abusive, insulting or threatening words or behaviour in public, including in his own garden, nor play loud music in his car, nor form a group of three unless they are his family. Police said he was in a gang which had been behind an increase in crime in Monsall, Manchester.
