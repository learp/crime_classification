The Home Secretary, Jack Straw, must have agonised before instructing the Government's lawyers to obtain a "gagging" injunction against the Sunday Telegraph to prevent it from publishing substantial extracts from the leaked Macpherson Report on the Stephen Lawrence case. He knew from past, personal experience, that such injunctions can only expect to "hold the ring" for a very short time. The governmental gag imposed in December 1997 to prevent the naming of his son's possible involvement in criminal proceedings for the purchase of drugs was quickly lifted. As the Spycatcher saga shows - when Margaret Thatcher sought to prevent the British press from publishing details of what became a best-selling book by the ex-M15 officer, Peter Wright - "information anywhere is quickly information everywhere." The Government in that case was condemned finally by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for not having accorded free speech the respect that it deserved and is guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They continued to maintain the media ban long after the contents of Spycatcher were widely known.  The facts of the Lawrence Report injunction, granted by Mr Justice Rix, are different as the information had not been so widely disseminated. However, it had already entered the public domain - the first copies of the Sunday Telegraph had already been distributed and highlights had been broadcast by ITN at the time the injunction was being obtained. In those circumstances, it was surely inevitable that the information would spread very quickly here, abroad and on the Internet, and that the injunction would have to be lifted, as indeed it was the next day.  Straw, left licking his wounds, might have reflected on the wound which he had just inflicted on our free speech. The Spycatcher case also established that in cases concerning government information - and the Macpherson Report would fall squarely into this category - the Government must actually prove, and not just merely assert, that publication would harm the national interest.  This is because of the compelling need to ensure that all government activity is open to scrutiny and debate. It is a more stringent test than applies to ordinary litigants when they try to suppress, for example, confidential commercial information.  Straw was fully aware of this background when he sought and obtained the restraining order on Saturday, February 20. Moreover, it was he who decided to amend the Human Rights Act 1998 which, when effective (in late 1999 or early 2000), will incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights directly into our domestic law. Gagging injunctions will then be more difficult to obtain.  Section 12 of the Act says that if a court is considering granting a temporary injunction to prevent media publication, therefore affecting the right to free speech enshrined in Article 10, the court must not grant the injunction unless it is satisfied that at any full trial the injunction would be maintained. The court will have specifically to consider "the extent to which the material has, or is about to become, available to the public". Luckily for Straw, his government's own human rights legislation was not in force at the time he sought, and obtained, the restraining order. If it had been, it is doubtful whether it could have been granted. It would appear to be strongly arguable that the injunction was in breach of Article 10 principles. Was it really enough for the Government to assert that advance publication would be unfair to the Lawrence family and to the Metropolitan Police? Probably not.  It is easy for the Government to make assertions and always very difficult for the media to refute them.  Even if it was lawful to try and keep the information under wraps for a few days, it is curious why the Government obtained a "blanket" ban. There was no proviso in the injunction to allow the publication of information which had already taken place. In the injunction against the ex-MI5 officer, David Shayler, there is a proviso to exempt previously published information from the injunction and information which the Government's lawyers "clear" for publication. Such more balanced injunctions are more likely to survive the scrutiny of the European Court of Human Rights. No doubt the Sunday Telegraph is considering an application there to recover the costs to which it was put in stopping some of its print run last Saturday evening.  It is to be hoped that the Human Rights Act and judges construing its provisions will prevent further embarrassing recurrences of our Government trying to prevent the publication of information which has already, or is about to become, publicly available. Straw need not have sought the injunction. He could have immediately informed the Lawrence family and the Metropolitan Police of what had happened and what the media already knew. By the time of the injunction, it was already too late to stop the spread of the information.  The lesson remains that if the Government wants to keep information secret it must ensure that Crown servants and others do not leak it. Once a report has reached a national newspaper, the cat is almost certainly out of the bag and it is pointless to try and suppress the information. This is all the more pointless when the information is shortly and inevitably to be made public.  Straw may reflect on what has happened and perhaps be less ready to wield the power of gagging orders in the future. Instead he could speed up publication of the long-awaited Freedom of Information Bill and consider further liberalising the Official Secrets legislation.
