David Cameron today joined the row over the government's controversial anti-social behaviour orders, claiming that they simply reacted to youth crime rather than reducing it.The Conservative leader's intervention came as the first ever independent evaluation of anti-social behaviour orders branded the government's flagship initiative "ineffective" and said that youths regarded Asbos as a "badge of honour".Addressing the Youth Justice Convention in Cardiff today, Mr Cameron said that Britain now needed a "pro-social policy" to complement anti-social behaviour orders.He told youth justice professionals: "We mustn't demonise young people."If all we have to say to those kids is that you're feral, that you deserve an Asbo, that you should be in custody, we will simply be reacting to youth crime in stead of reducing it."Today's survey by the Policy Research Bureau and Nacro, the crime reduction charity, found that 49% of Asbo recipients had breached their orders - the majority on more than one occasion - and been returned to court.This increased the long-term likelihood of teenagers being jailed, it found.Mr Cameron, who famously gave a speech this year calling defending young people's right to wear a "hoodie", called for a twin-pronged approach of both justice and love.He said: "We have to show a lot more love. By that I don't mean sentimental, childish love which sees no wrong in anyone."I mean tough love, love that values people, and therefore demands high standards from them."Mr Cameron - again venturing into territory previously largely outside traditional Tory concerns - promised a future Conservative government would "roll forward the frontiers of society" in the way that Margaret Thatcher had "roll[ed] back the frontiers of the state".He said: "Our youth justice system isn't working properly at punishing and deterring crime. And our society isn't giving enough support to young people to stop them becoming criminals."A Tory approach would be "justice and love."Speaking at the Youth Justice Board's annual convention in Cardiff, the opposition leader said there should be more counselling, education and training in young offenders' institutions in a bid to reduce reoffending.And he said: "The life lived by thousands of young people in our big towns and cities is a disgrace to all of us."He reminded his audience that he was a Conservative who believed individuals were responsible for their actions, but added: "To those who simply say, 'Crime is the fault of the criminal and that's all there is to it,' I say: 'Tell it to the young offender.'"Tell a 16-year-old boy, abandoned by his father, neglected by his mother, on drugs, dyslexic, hyperactive... tell that boy it's all his own fault when he ends up in Feltham," the young offenders' institute in Middlesex.He added: "When Tony Blair said he wanted to be tough on the causes of crime, I'm sure he meant it at the time."A few months ago I gave a speech about youth crime to the Centre for Social Justice."I talked about hoodies, and Tony Blair made a joke about it in his party conference speech."With that cheap joke he gave up on one of the best things he ever said: 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime'."Mr Cameron echoed a frequent Tory complaint, that the government had legislated for new offences without enforcing existing ones.He said: "This government has thrown every sort of criminal justice measure it can at the problem of youth crime: Asbos, home detention curfews, fixed penalty notices."They've created a new criminal offence for every day they've been in office, 29 criminal justice acts of parliament, massive reorganisations of prisons, of probation, of the courts. No one can say they haven't tried."But the result of all this effort and energy? An epidemic of low-level disorder and disrespect."What we really need is what I said in that speech about hoodies."Not a more powerful state, but a more powerful society."Tony McNulty, the junior Home Office minister, said Mr Cameron was "utterly wrong"."When you look in substance behind the fluffy-bunny language, there's not much there. "He talks about the voluntary sector having a larger role [but] the voluntary sector has never had a larger role than they have over the last 10 years and are working alongside and in partnership with the state."He says he wants a more powerful society and then... he doesn't understand where the state fits in there," he added.
