Long overdue proposals for a criminal offence of corporate manslaughter make clear that public-sector bodies will face being sued for fatal accidents.The draft legislation published yesterday also confirms that directors and senior managers will not individually face prosecution and threat of jail. The maximum penalty will be an unlimited fine on firms. The demand for the classification grew after serious rail and ferry disasters in the 1990s. Labour pledged to introduce a law in its 2001 manifesto. The TUC estimates that 249 workers and 385 members of the public are killed in workplace incidents every year. The decision to extend the offence to cover the public sector by lifting crown immunity from prosecution was widely welcomed yesterday, with the TUC's general secretary, Brendan Barber, saying: "This proposed [law] will help make the workplace safer by providing a new sanction against those organisations who show scant regard for the health and safety of their employees." But the Prison Service and the armed forces are to be exempted from the law. Senior civil servants will also be exempt from prosecution. The law is designed to overcome the existing legal need to show a single individual at the top of a company being personally guilty of manslaughter before a case can be brought.
