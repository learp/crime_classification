A 59-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder following a burglary at his home has been released without charge after it was deemed he had used reasonable force after being confronted by four masked men.Peter Flanagan, 59, was detained after the death of John Bennell, 27, who died from a stab wound to the chest after a number of masked men, one of whom was armed with a machete, broke into Flanagan's home. He had been due to answer police bail on Monday.Nazir Afzal, the chief crown prosecutor for the north-west, said: "I have today told the police of my decision that Peter Flanagan should not face any charges in connection with the death of John Bennell, an intruder who broke into his home in Salford on 22 June."I am satisfied that Peter Flanagan acted in self-defence after being woken by noises downstairs in his house shortly before midnight. On investigating the disturbance he was confronted by intruders, one of whom was armed with a machete."In a case such as this I have to ask myself whether the use of force was necessary and whether it was reasonable in the circumstances. People are entitled to use reasonable force in self-defence to defend themselves, their family and their property."Greater Manchester police said they respected the prosecutor's decision. Peter Flanagan's 27-year-old son Neil and his girlfriend, who contacted emergency services, were also arrested following the incident, but were later released without charge.At the time of the burglary, John Bennell was on bail for another burglary in Staffordshire. His family have been informed of the decision not to pursue charges against Flanagan.Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan of Greater Manchester police said: "When presented with the circumstances of that evening we made the right and proper decision to make the arrests. We had a duty of care to John Bennell's family, the occupants of the house and to the coroner to fully investigate this death to determine whether or not it was a criminal act or one of self-defence. I am satisfied that we provided the full facts of the case to the CPS and I respect their decision."Martin Jamieson, 27, of Eccles, and Wesley Gibbons, 23, of Stretford, have been charged with aggravated burglary in connection with the incident. Christopher Troy, 23, of Hyde, is also charged with aggravated burglary and possession of a bladed article.
