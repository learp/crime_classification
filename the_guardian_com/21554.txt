The singer, George Michael, was today ordered to do 100 hours' community service and banned from driving for two years for driving while unfit.Michael escaped a jail term when he appeared for sentencing before the Brent magistrates' court, in north London. The sentence means he is free to play the first concert at the new Wembley stadium tomorrow.Michael, who said he was "ashamed" of his behaviour, had admitted the charge after he was found semi-conscious at the wheel of his Mercedes in Cricklewood, north London, last October. He had claimed he was affected by "tiredness and prescribed drugs".Last month, the court heard that Michael, 43, had a cocktail of drugs in his system, including GHB and cannabis.After the sentencing, the former Wham! frontman walked into the sunshine and attacked media coverage of the case as "farcical and almost entirely based on the prosecution's allegations." He said: "I am glad to put this behind me and now I'm off to do the biggest show of my life." Tests showed a therapeutic quantity of an anti-depressant in the singer's system, as well as illegal dance club drug GHB - a class C substance. But Michael's defence counsel said GHB could be present in the blood without any illegal substances having been taken.Today in court he repeated he was ashamed of what he had done because of the danger posed to other people. Referring to a previous hearing in May, when he pleaded guilty to the offence, he said: "When I was talking in the last hearing about being ashamed that's what I was ashamed of, because of the risk to others."I was ashamed I had done something really wrong in putting other people at risk."Brian Spiro, defending, said Michael had returned from a concert in Paris, was very tired and had taken various medicines including a sleeping pill.He had then been given a DVD of his most recent concert and had attempted to drive to another home he owned in north London to watch it as his machine was broken.Mr Spiro told the court: "He now fully accepts to have got into the car on that occasion, given his tiredness, given the medication he had been given was the wrong, improper thing to do."The prosecution counsel, Andrew Torrington, told the court that Michael was found slumped at the wheel of his car after witnesses observed the vehicle weaving into the wrong side of the road at around five to ten miles an hour in the early hours of the morning.Witnesses saw him stop at traffic lights and remain stationary through several changes of the lights before pulling off in a way they thought might cause an accident.The witnesses "described his behaviour as being bewildered, frightened, confused and apparently under the influence, as they described it, of drugs", when they approached the car, Mr Torrington said.Mr Torrington said cannabis was also found in Michael's blood, but the prosecution did not maintain that this was the cause of his intoxication. Michael has admitted he is addicted to prescription drugs and believes the world would be a better place if more people smoked marijuana. He attributed his erratic behaviour to an attention-seeking and "self-destructive" impulse brought on by the death of his mother a decade ago.
