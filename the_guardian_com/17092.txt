It comes as no surprise to me that Dartmoor has been awarded one of the lowest performance ratings. It is a dinosaur, struggling to exist in an era that it was never intended to see.Dartmoor has been earmarked for closure since 1978 when Lord Justice May described the prison as "nowadays simply against nature"; certainly my personal experiences have not dimmed in the 15 years since I last left there.Arriving at the prison late one afternoon I was placed in a "dog box" in reception, a space 3ft square with a ledge to sit on. The door opened and a "mystery" bowl of congealed stew was thrust at me in which the plastic spoon stood vertical.The shower gave a trickle of cold, brown water, and the clothes I was handed bore little relation to my correct size.The dreaded E hall punishment wing came straight out of the 18th century, with white lines on the floor indicating where you could walk, and three "strip cells" at the end in which I soon found myself for breaking the Dartmoor rules.Some things have changed at Dartmoor since then: E hall has been closed as a punishment wing, and its barred cages in which exercise had to be taken were shut down only last year after the chief inspector of prisons described them as more suitable for dangerous animals than human beings.But it is the culture of Dartmoor which has caused so many of its problems.Today the prison provides limited purposeful activity (just 20 hours a week), has poor drug figures (11.3% positive), a lack of offending behaviour programmes, high numbers of staff sickness, and there are still cells at Dartmoor which do not have their own sanitation.Its governor, Claudia Sturt, has been in post less than a week and comes to the prison with a good reputation for being able to identify reforms and more importantly drive them through.But I fear Dartmoor will prove to be a test too far even for Ms Sturt. It is a prison which is destined to close unless its staff finally rise to the challenge that has been set, and show they too are capable of introducing the reforms it so urgently needs.Â· Mark Leech is the editor and publisher of The Prisons Handbook.
