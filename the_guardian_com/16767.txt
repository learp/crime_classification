In hindsight, perhaps it was not the most sensible thing for the defendant to say to the court.Lee Pickton, charged with kidnapping, told a jury that if he and his mates had been beating somebody up "they would be dead". He went on to admit he had nine previous convictions for burglary, theft, drink driving, assault and harassment. On each occasion he had pleaded guilty, and he said that therefore he would have "owned up" had he been responsible for the attack on Nicholas Wilsonham, 24. Pickton, 31, of east London, was yesterday found guilty at Snaresbrook crown court of kidnapping and assaulting Mr Wilsonham during a horrific ordeal in which he was scalped and dangled in front of a pit bull terrier. The court heard that Pickton dangled Nicholas Wilsonham's leg in front of the dog, shouting: "Bite him." Mr Wilsonham broke down in the witness box after recalling how he was attacked by a group of about 10 men, put in a headlock, kicked and dragged into a house where he was punched and his front teeth were knocked out. He was hospitalised and left with a broken rib and extensive bruising. He said Pickton and several other men tried unsuccessfully to goad the pit bull terrier into biting him, before one of the men used a blade to cut off parts of his scalp. The jury yesterday found Pickton guilty of kidnap, false imprisonment and assault. The motive for the attack remains a mystery, but Mr Wilsonham, who is 5ft 5in tall, said his attackers began shouting and swearing at him. He told the jury that he used to be friends with Pickton and that they had shared a house for a few days. Sentence was adjourned until September 5 for reports. Pickton was remanded in custody.
