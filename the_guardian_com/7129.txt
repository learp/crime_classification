Detectives investigating the murder of a young bride who was found shot dead in her home discovered a shotgun at her house last night, police said today.The body of hairdresser Chanel Taylor, 23, was found by her new husband Lee a week ago in the house they shared in Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire. Her father, Terry Rodgers, who was also living with the couple, disappeared following the shooting and police were today issuing "wanted" posters in a desperate bid to trace him.Police said they could not reveal at this stage whether the shotgun found hidden in the house was the murder weapon. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Cottee said: "Following the discovery of Chanel's body on Friday July 30, the house was sealed and an initial firearms search was conducted but came back negative. "From that point onwards, every inch of every room is subject to a thorough forensic examination. "The house is a crime scene and rooms must be searched consecutively. "This is done to ensure we can gather as much forensic evidence as possible so that nothing is missed. "As the shotgun was not found in a visible position, scenes of crime officers were not alerted to its presence until its precise location was examined yesterday. "It cannot be confirmed if this was the weapon used to kill Chanel Taylor."
