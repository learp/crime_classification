Jurors in the Damilola Taylor murder trial began deliberating their verdicts yesterday afternoon after the judge finished his summing up of the evidence in the case at the Old Bailey.Before allowing the jury to retire, Mr Justice Hooper told the seven men and four women that they were "to take as much time as you need there is no pressure of time on you." He also warned them not to talk to each other about the case outside the precinct of the court, or to try to conduct their own investigations into what happened to Damilola in Blakes Road, Peckham, south London, on November 27, 2000. Earlier the judge reminded the jury that it could not take into account the evidence provided by a 14-year-old girl who claimed she had seen four boys surround and stab Damilola. A main prosecution witness, her testimony was ruled inadmissible when she admitted to the court that parts of her final statement to the police were untrue. The prosecution claims that Damilola, 10, was stabbed in the left leg by two 16-year-old brothers, known as Boy A and Boy B. They have been charged with murder, manslaughter and intent to rob. Defence barristers have argued that the police were under so much pressure to find the killers that they ignored the possibility that Damilola could have been injured accidentally after falling on broken glass. The boys' mobile phones were activated almost two miles from the scene, minutes after Damilola was injured, suggesting they could not have been there, the court heard. Two of the original four defendants were found not guilty on the directions of the judge after he threw out the evidence of the teenage girl.
