A suspected thief more Pooh Bear than cat burglar was caught not so much red-handed as guilty-buttocked today after his plan to squeeze his way into a house in east London went horribly, humiliatingly wrong.The alleged miscreant – and incurable optimist – appears to have thought he could sneak into the property in Bow through a window measuring just 12 inches by eight inches. He was wrong.After spending almost six hours with his hind quarters dangling gracelessly out of the window, the man was eventually rescued by firefighters after someone inside the house came down to breakfast and was greeted by a tired head and torso.A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers had been called at 7.30am "to reports of a male found stuck in a downstairs window".He added: "It appears the resident had come down and found the man. He was stuck half in, half out."The man was finally freed after the London fire brigade removed the window frame that had trapped his buttocks. A brigade spokesman said it had taken firefighters just under half an hour to give the embarrassed individual the bum's rush.The man, who is 36, was arrested on suspicion of burglary and taken to an east London police station.
