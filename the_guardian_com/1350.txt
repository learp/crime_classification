Police are tied down by excessive bureaucracy and a "risk-averse" culture, and should be freed up to use their own judgment and discretion, a major report commissioned by the Home Office said today.Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief inspector of constabulary, said that while much of the paperwork required for police was well-intentioned - for example, to protect minorities and the vulnerable - it often prevented officers making their own decisions.His report, published today, sets out 26 recommendations for police forces in England and Wales.As well as tackling excessive form-filling and paperwork, the 59-page document sets out measures to make police work more local and accountable - for example, by allowing unpaid volunteers to become police community support officers (PCSOs).Sir Ronnie condemned the "sometimes inordinate amount of time" expended by police on very minor crimes, such as playground altercations, so as to meet clear-up targets.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, welcomed the report, saying it contained "really sensible suggestions"."Sir Ronnie has come up with some really good practical steps in his review that I am certainly going to want, alongside the police service and others across government, to make sure that we take forward," she told GMTV.Introducing his proposals on bureaucracy, Sir Ronnie noted that while much paperwork had been imposed on police, some was "self-created" to protect against future complaints."The risk of this approach is that there is created a culture of risk aversion which can seriously dilute, or at worst remove, discretion or professional judgment," he said.Sir Ronnie singled out paperwork connected to police stopping and questioning people on the street. Details of those stopped are recorded to make sure, among other things, ethnic minorities are not being unfairly targeted, a recommendation of the Macpherson report connected to the murder of Steven Lawrence.While such bureaucracy was planned "with a totally positive aim in mind", its effect was stifling, Sir Ronnie said, noting that one force calculated paperwork connected to stop and account alone took up almost 33,000 hours in 2006, the equivalent of 16 full-time staff.Sir Ronnie said the Home Office and police authorities "must demonstrate clear national leadership on the issue of risk aversion and commit themselves to genuinely new ways of working to foster a culture in which officers and staff can rediscover their discretion to exercise professional judgment".Much of this would be "unglamorous", he said, requiring action such as national targets for reducing paperwork and the creation of standardised forms to be used nationally.Another key area to be considered was the recording and investigation of "a vast swath of minor crimes", he said."An emphasis on sanction detection levels has undoubtedly to a degree produced the unintended effect of officers spending time investigating crimes with a view to obtaining a detection, even when that is clearly not in the public interest," he said."An example of such would be a low-level playground common assault. The sometimes inordinate amount of time spent by officers in such tasks could and should be channelled into more appropriate activity."The report called for a "rebalancing" between central targets for policing and what local people actually want, and said PCSOs could be part of this."Research shows that many PCSOs apply for the role because they want to undertake a community safety and engagement role that is less 'confrontational' than that of a police officer, and 'give something back' to society," Sir Ronnie said."There are likely to be a number of people who fall into this category, and who might be interested in voluntarily giving up their time to assist neighbourhood policing."Â·The article above was amended on Thursday September 20 2007.
