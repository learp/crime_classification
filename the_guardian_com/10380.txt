A 61-year-old man has appeared in court accused of murdering four soldiers who died in the IRA bombing of Hyde Park in 1982.On Wednesday morning, John Anthony Downey, of County Donegal, Ireland, was charged with the murder of four members of the Royal Household Cavalry who were killed as they travelled through the park to Buckingham Palace.Downey appeared at Westminster magistrates court just after 2pm. He greeted his solicitor, Gareth Peirce, through the glass screen of the dock of court one where he was flanked by two officers but spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address.Downey – who is accused of murdering Roy John Bright, Dennis Richard Anthony Daly, Simon Andrew Tipper and Geoffrey Vernon Young on 20 July 1982 – has also been charged with "unlawfully and maliciously" intending to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property.He was remanded in custody by Judge Quentin Purdy until Friday, when he will appear at the Old Bailey for a bail hearing. A preliminary hearing will take place on 5 June.Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "The Metropolitan police service has been investigating the explosion near Hyde Park in London which occurred on 20 July 1982. We have reviewed the evidence gathered and authorised them to charge John Anthony Downey, 61, of County Donegal, Ireland."It is alleged that Downey is responsible for the improvised explosive device contained in a car parked in South Carriage Drive, SW1, London, which resulted in the deaths of four members of the Royal Household Cavalry, Blues and Royals, as they travelled on their daily route from their barracks to Buckingham Palace."Eight soldiers were killed in Hyde Park and Regents Park in the IRA bombings almost 31 years ago.In the first blast a nail bomb in a blue Austin car was detonated as members of the Household Cavalry made their way to the changing of the guard from their barracks in Knightsbridge. Seven horses were killed or so badly maimed they had to be destroyed.The second explosive device was detonated underneath the bandstand inside Regents Park as bandsmen from the Royal Green Jackets were performing songs from the musical Oliver for the public.Admitting responsibility at the time, the IRA said it had carried out the attacks in a statement echoing Margaret Thatcher's declaration of war on Argentina over the disputed Falkland Islands. It repeated her remarks about the right of self-determination and continued: "The Irish people have sovereign and national rights which no task or occupational force can put down."In October 1987 the Queen's University Belfast physics graduate Gilbert McNamee, 27, was jailed for conspiracy to cause explosions between 1982 and 1984.The judge at the Old Bailey found him guilty of bombing offences that included the Hyde Park bomb and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was released in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday agreement. Later that year his conviction was overturned by the court of appeal, which ruled it unsafe.Under the Good Friday deal, anyone convicted of a terrorist offence which took place before 15 April 1998 can request to be transferred to a prison in Northern Ireland and then apply to the sentence review commissioners to be released after serving two years.
