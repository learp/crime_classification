Detectives at a specialist sexual offences unit faced fresh claims today that they failed two women who made rape complaints in south London last month. The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an inquiry after the women complained about how officers in Southwark handled their cases. Both cases are thought to focus on basic procedures. The unit, known as a sapphire team, was criticised earlier this year after a 15-year-old girl complained about how officers investigated her case. The IPCC found hundreds of rapes and sex attacks were passed to untrained staff.
