Five crack cocaine dealers whose activities have caused misery on several housing estates have been barred by court order from entering north Kensington, in west London, in what is thought to be a legal first.The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which brought the case under civil rather than criminal law, said it was the first time section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972, designed to deal with persistent nuisances, had been used to get rid of drug dealers. Mr Justice Ouseley banned two men and three women, all with criminal records, from entering the northern third of the borough, except for picking up children or keeping hospital appointments. If they breach the injunction, they face up to five years in jail. The council was also granted an order preventing the five from entering any property in the borough where controlled drugs are sold or consumed. Mr Justice Ouseley accepted evidence that crack houses were being set up in the homes of vulnerable council tenants, who were subjected to pressure and intimidation. Evidence from police, local authority managers and tenants showed that a nuisance was being created "by large numbers of people who attend the crack houses, by shouting and screaming, associated prostitution, the leaving of drug paraphernalia, urine and faeces". Evidence proved the defendants - Georgette Williams, Theresa Chase, Joanne Dowling, Brian Ellis, and Frankie Charles - had been involved over a long period in operation of crack houses, the judge said.
