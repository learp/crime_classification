A woman has told investigators her ex-partner was pinning her against a wall at knifepoint when he was shot dead by police.A police marksman shot at the 40-year-old man twice at around 1am on Friday after officers were called to a disturbance at the woman's flat on Shepperton Road in Islington, north London.The woman, named in reports as 54-year-old cleaner Julie Moyses, explained in her witness statement that the man was holding her against a wall and carrying a knife at the time of the incident, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said.It coincided with the account given by the officer who pulled the trigger, the IPCC said.A postmortem found that the man died as a result of shock and haemorrhage caused by a gunshot wound to the left chest.He also suffered a bullet wound to his upper left arm.It was the first fatal shooting by a Metropolitan police marksman since the death of Mark Duggan in 2011.Moyses' son, Derek, told reporters that the man and his mother had previously lived together nearby but had split up at the beginning of the year.Officers who attended the scene have provided statements and the marksman who fired the shots will be interviewed by the IPCC in the coming days.Investigators are also looking at CCTV footage and have been conducting house-to-house enquiries.Police were called to the address at around 11.14pm last Thursday following a 999 call. The area was cordoned off and an ambulance called.The IPCC said that it was providing support for members of the dead man's family and the victim.IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said: "I have today met with members of the bereaved family, who are very distressed, to extend my condolences and to update them on the progress of our investigation."I would like to assure all those concerned that the circumstances surrounding this tragedy will be investigated thoroughly."The IPCC said it was not in a position to name the man until he was formally identified.
