A bankrupt businessman jailed for life for murdering a solicitor, whom he blamed for the break-up of his relationship and repossession of his £1m home, has been found dead in his prison cell.Michael Chudley shot the solicitor, James Ward, 58, in his office at MGW Law, in Devizes, Wiltshire, two years ago.The 63-year-old property developer was jailed for life last year and was to serve at least 28 years' imprisonment after being convicted of the murder.Salisbury crown court heard Chudley walked into the solicitor's office and shot him in the head once at close range with a sawn-off shotgun as he spoke to a client on the telephone. The force of the blast blew out a window of the first-floor town centre office.Ward, who was known as Jim, suffered catastrophic head injuries and died almost three weeks later in hospital.Chudley, who had changed his name from Mike Russell, had lost his home and his business after becoming embroiled in a long-running legal dispute over building work. The man he unsuccessfully sued, Christopher Sear, had instructed Ward, and Chudley had been facing the prospect of paying legal costs of more than £250,000.Prosecutors said Chudley, who by this time had either been renting rooms in local pubs or sleeping in his car, acted out of revenge, anger and resentment.He denied murder but admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, claiming he was suffering from an abnormality of mental function at the time.Last week Chudley failed in the appeal court to clear his name.The Prison Service said he was found in his cell on Tuesday morning, three days before his 64th birthday.A spokeswoman said: "HMP Winchester prisoner Michael Chudley was found unresponsive in his cell shortly before 5.50am on 8 April. Paramedics attended and attempted CPR but he was pronounced dead at 6.36am. As with all deaths in custody, the prisons and probation ombudsman will conduct an investigation."
