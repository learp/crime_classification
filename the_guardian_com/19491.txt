The couple charged with deception in the saga of the missing canoeist yesterday made emotional appeals for a family reunion as they faced up to the prospect of Christmas in prison.Anne Darwin, 55, who was yesterday remanded in custody by magistrates who had sent her husband John to Durham prison 24 hours earlier, issued a plea through her solicitor for reconciliation with her two estranged sons. She was also considering a message forwarded by her husband's lawyer about their 29th wedding anniversary in nine days' time. Darwin, who reappeared earlier this month after being declared dead in a canoeing tragedy five years ago, said he was "desperate" to try to sort things out.Speaking shortly before Mrs Darwin appeared before magistrates in Hartlepool, Darwin's solicitor, John Nixon, said: "He is anxious about her well-being and the fact that they are going to spend their wedding day apart. He is anxious for everything to be resolved."In court Mrs Darwin, a former probation officer and teacher, was charged with dishonestly obtaining a £25,000 life insurance payment and a mortgage policy worth £137,000 in the event of her husband's death. Darwin was remanded to Durham jail on Monday charged with dishonestly obtaining £25,000 and making an untrue statement to procure a passport.The couple's two sons, Anthony, 32, and Mark, 30, last week issued a statement cutting links with their parents.Mrs Darwin's solicitor, Nicola Finnerty, said her client hoped their attitude would change. "She is obviously concerned about her family," she said. "If her sons would like to see her, she would like to see them. "Cleveland police said they had received a dozen calls about a photograph they released on Monday showing Darwin with a straggly beard.
