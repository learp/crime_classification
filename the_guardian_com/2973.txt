Paul BrittonThe forensic psychologist was given too much power to lead the police inquiry, the Met admits now. According to Mr Justice Ognall he "pulled the strings" of the undercover operation involving a honeytrap to entice a confession from Colin Stagg. All the officers, the judge says, took their orders from him. Britton missed connections between the Green Chain rapes, the killings of Samantha Bissett and her daughter Jazmine, and the Nickell murder. Britton faced seven disciplinary charges from his professional body. They were dropped in 2002 because they were out of time. He is no longer on the approved list of behavioural experts used by police. Britton has not apologised to Stagg.Det Insp Keith PedderThe investigating officer failed to make connections with the murders of Bissett and her daughter or with the rape inquiry in south-east London. He approved and led the undercover operation against Stagg. His pursuit of Stagg appeared to close his mind to the possibility of other suspects. He argues that more senior officers and leading prosecutors approved the sting. Crown Prosecution ServiceSenior prosecution lawyers approved the honeytrap. They pursued the case despite the flimsy evidence against Stagg. When Robert Napper was charged with the murders of the Bissetts, prosecutors failed to see they had two men on remand for very similar killings.Ian JohnstonThen Met deputy assistant commissioner of the Met, now chief constable of British Transport police, he was the most senior officer to approve the operation against Stagg. Pedder says some blame must lie with senior officers.
