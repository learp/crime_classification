Thieves who stole more than £80,000 of jewellery from a house in Liverpool while the owners' 16-year-old son was having a party, discarded some of the items on nearby wasteland, detectives said yesterday.Officers, who returned the recovered items, said an armed gang burst into the property in Tuebrook, Liverpool, at 11pm on August 2 when the teenager was in the house with six friends as his parents continued their holiday in France.The gang locked the 16-year-old in a room while they raided the house. The party guests were forced out of the premises at knifepoint.Merseyside police returned some of the antique jewellery pieces to the boy's mother, a secondary school teacher who cut short her two-week summer holiday with her husband because of the burglary.More than 500 items were taken after the gang, reportedly of 10 white youths, ripped two electronically coded safes from the walls of the house.The stolen goods included a pair of gold, silver, diamond, emerald, ruby and topaz earrings, as well as necklaces and rings and a tanzanite and diamond pendant on platinum, a 50th birthday present from the owner's husband.The rare jewellery collection had been built up over 30 years and had been collected from around the world, from countries including Egypt and Israel. Police have said that because the items are unusual they would be difficult to sell on. Jewellers in the area have been advised to look out for any of the stolen gems.The thieves also caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to the £190,000 semi-detached home when they tore down curtains, smashed a banister and broke a lavatory.A spokeswoman for Merseyside police urged anyone who might have found the gems to hand them back.Detectives said that they feared that many of the valuable items might have been taken by local children who played on wasteland at nearby Windsor Road.The police spokeswoman said: "Inquires in the neighbourhood have revealed that further items of jewellery may have been innocently found and taken by local children. We appeal to anyone who may have innocently found any jewellery to hand it in to police so it can be returned to its rightful owner."Also, we would like anyone with any information as to how the jewellery got there to get in touch."
