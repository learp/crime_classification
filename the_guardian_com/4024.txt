Police today questioned former American football star OJ Simpson about a break-in at a Las Vegas casino hotel room, involving sports memorabilia.The break-in was reported at the Palace Station casino, an ageing property just west of the Las Vegas strip, late last night, police said.Simpson was released and is believed to be in Las Vegas."We don't believe he's going anywhere," a police spokesman said. Simpson had been scheduled to give a deposition in Miami in a bankruptcy case involving his eldest daughter. But it was postponed after Simpson told attorneys he would be out of town. The Palace Station hotel complex includes a 430-room Courtyard hotel and a 21-storey hotel tower with 500 rooms and suites.The incident coincided with the publication today of the controversial book, If I Did It. The book, about the murder of Simpson's former wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald Goldman, was cancelled by HarperCollins after a public outcry.In August 2007, a Florida bankruptcy court awarded the book rights to the Goldman family to partially satisfy an unpaid civil judgment. The title of the book was changed to If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer, and is being published by Beaufort Books.Comments were added to the original manuscript by the Goldman family, the writer Pablo Fenjves, and the prominent investigative journalist Dominick Dunne. A civil jury found Simpson, an actor and former American football player, financially liable for the deaths of his wife and Mr Goldman in a civil trial. He was acquitted of murder charges in a 1995 criminal trial that transfixed America.Mr Fenjves said the book's original publisher told him it was a confession. Mr Fenjves writes in a prologue that Judith Regan, then of ReganBooks/HarperCollins, told him: "He wants to confess, and I'm being assured it's a confession. But this is the only way he'll do it."
