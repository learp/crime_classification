The sons of a woman shot dead while her son-in-law was on bail paid tribute to their mother yesterday, describing her as a kind and caring person.Tom Khan and Paul Carne spoke of the deep "sense of loss" over the death of Traute Maxfield, 70, who was killed at her Hertfordshire home apparently by Garry Weddell, a senior police officer charged with murdering his wife, Sandra.Weddell, 47, released on a Â£200,000 surety , is thought to have shot himself in a field near a gun club on Saturday after killing Maxfield, a former community care worker. She had been due to give evidence at his trial in May.In a joint statement released through Hertfordshire police, Khan, 47, an officer with Bedfordshire police, and Carne, 48, an IT specialist, said: "Mum was a loving, caring and kind person who had a genuine zest for life and an infectious sense of humour."At Christmas she was even joining in with the grandchildren on the Nintendo Wii and laughing about how her arm would ache for a week."The brothers both live in Bedfordshire, and have a second sister, Liza Devlin, 45, living overseas.They did not comment on Judge John Bevan's decision to grant Weddell bail at a court in Ipswich in September. They paid tribute to their dead sister: "Sandra shared many of Mum's qualities. She was a devoted mother, cared for other people, and worked as a nurse at the Luton and Dunstable hospital, where she lectured in renal dialysis."Like Mum, she was talented at needlework, loved the church, and even found time to help out at the local Sunday school. Words alone cannot describe our sense of loss following their deaths."Sandra Weddell, 44, was last seen alive on January 30. Her body was found the following day in the couple's garage, with a cable tied round her neck and what appeared to be a suicide note nearby. Detectives subsequently became unhappy with the circumstances surrounding her death "given the unusual and bizarre means" used. Checks with police forces around the UK revealed only three other deaths with cable ties - and all three had been murder. Detectives then came to believe that what had been thought to be the suicide note was a forgery.On June 26 detectives arrested Weddell and charged him with murder.Last night there were renewed calls for an inquiry after the attorney general, Baroness Scotland QC, denied reports that she would be investigating the bail decision by Judge Bevan.
