Winston Silcott, who was convicted and later cleared on appeal of murdering PC Keith Blakelock during the 1985 Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham, north London, has been released from prison.Mr Silcott, who has been released on licence after serving 17 years for the murder of another man, walked free from Blantyre House open prison, in Kent, on Friday.Last Wednesday, it was announced that he would be freed after ministers had backed a parole board verdict that he posed no risk to the public.Mr Silcott's solicitor, Tony Murphy, said his client "remains intent on proving his innocence" of the murder of Anthony Smith, whom he stabbed to death during a fight in December 1984.He maintains that he was acting in self-defence when he fatally stabbed Mr Smith at a party in east London.It was while on bail awaiting trial for that offence that Mr Silcott was accused of being part of the mob that set upon PC Blakelock, who was hacked to death. In March 1987, he was convicted of murdering the police officer. In 1991, the verdict was overturned on appeal as "unsafe" because of tainted police evidence. A Prison Service spokeswoman said that 43-year-old Mr Silcott had been due for release on Tuesday morning but added that, because he was already out of jail, arrangements would be made for him to sign his life licence at a secret location.Last week, PC Blakelock's widow, Elizabeth, said: "If the man is going to be let out of prison, then nothing I can do will change that. In a way, it must be felt that this person has done his time - but to me, life should mean life. "But I do believe that guilty people will be brought to justice, and we will see people being punished for what they did to Keith." Mr Silcott's solicitors have pointed out that his original sentence came with a 14-year tariff, but he has now spent more than 17 years behind bars.He was believed to be planning to return to Tottenham, his former home area, and will be required to comply with strict licence conditions for the rest of his life. Deterioration in his behaviour or the committing of another offence would see him put back into custody.
