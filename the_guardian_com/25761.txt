The images were issued by detectives investigating the incident in central London carried out by a man Scotland Yard has described as a "hugger mugger".The victim and his attacker met in the early hours and began chatting, the attacker talking about martial arts and acting out restraint moves.The student turned around and the suspect put his arm across his throat and squeezed.This caused the victim's legs to crumple as he passed out briefly and fell to the ground.The attacker then ripped the student's watch, a Â£5,000 Rolex Submariner with a silver bracelet and black face, off his wrist and fled.Investigating officer DC Michael Heaney said: "The suspect targeted his victim carefully, choosing someone who was a bit the worse for wear after a night out, alone and smartly dressed. The method he uses is not something we have seen before in this area and is a concern. Had the suspect applied more pressure the victim could have been far more seriously injured. As it was, he was just badly shaken."He is appealing for witnesses to the incident which happened on Heddon Street, near Regents Street, at around 3.35am on Saturday 10 May.Scotland Yard said the attacker told the victim he was Algerian.He was wearing a dark baseball-type jacket, dark blue jeans and a black baseball cap.He was bald with stubble, 5ft 8in and of muscular build.Witnesses are asked to call police on 0207 321 7513 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
