A coroner has called for radical overhaul of gun licensing at the conclusion of an inquest into a taxi driver who shot dead three members of his family before killing himself.Andrew Tweddle described the current system as flawed, adding that it was fortuitous there had not been more incidents like the one in Horden, near Peterlee, County Durham, on New Year's Day 2012.

Still resides with partner and son and daughter."Would like to refuse, have we sufficient to refuse re public safety?"He was nevertheless granted a shotgun licence and then a firearms licence two years later. His weapons were confiscated after he threatened to "blow his head off" in September 2008. But weeks later the guns were returned to him, with a final written warning telling him to behave responsibly.Tweddle said Durham police had conducted a thorough review of its firearms licensing practices since the tragedy."The review undertaken by Durham police has revealed an enormous number of unsatisfactory decisions having been made and it is fortuitous that, significant as this incident has been, there has not been more," he said.The coroner will write to the Home Office calling for "root and branch" changes and possibly legislation to how police license shotguns.The chief constable of Durham police, Michael Barton, offered an apology to the bereaved families. Giving evidence at the hearing, he said that before the shootings the force's hirearms licensing unit was too focused on administration and not enough on investigating whether applicants should be granted licences.The unit had come under investigation in 2008 and 2009 when a police constable, Damien Cobain, and a colleague were found to be selling on shotguns that had been handed in by the public.Barton said he was appalled by the officers' conduct – the pair have now left the force having been convicted – but said that was not linked to issues surrounding Atherton's licences.But Tweddle said an investigation of their crimes could have also revealed the lack of organisational control in the way licences were granted by the unit.Outside the hearing, Bobby Turnbull, Alison's son and Tanya's brother, said: "We consider the inquest has exposed some serious flaws in the way applications for shotguns and firearms were managed by Durham Constabulary firearms licensing unit."This includes lack of training if any at all, lack of process, lack of accountability, poor leadership and poor communication structure."
