A homeless man found dead in a burning tent in Greater Manchester was severely beaten before he died, police have revealed.Daniel Smith, 23, who was found at 1.20am on Wednesday under railway arches near Salford Central station, suffered multiple injuries and his tent had been deliberately set on fire, police said.Smith, from the Ashton-under-Lyne area near Manchester, had been sleeping rough for a number of years in Manchester and specialist officers are providing support to his family. Launching a murder inquiry, Chf Supt Mary Doyle from Greater Manchester police said members of the homeless community could hold the key to the investigation. “This is a tragic situation and we are working with other agencies to assist the local community,” she said. “We are determined to find out who is responsible and bring them to justice.”Smith was discovered by the fire service on Irwell Street in Ordsall, Salford, an area used by a number of homeless people to sleep. More rough sleepers live in a disused building nearby.Doyle said there had been “deliberate ignition” of the tent and a Home Office pathologist concluded Smith died from multiple injuries. Further pathology tests are to take place in an attempt to determine if Smith was killed by the beating or the fire.Doyle said: “Our enquiries over the past 24 hours have found that this man suffered a number of injuries before his body was discovered in the early hours of Wednesday in a tent following a fire and our thoughts are with Daniel’s family and friends at this terrible time.“We have been carrying out a joint investigation with the fire service to establish the cause of this fire, which is now being treated as a deliberate ignition.“We believe the answers to our questions about what happened to this man lie in the community, particularly other members of the homeless community who may have been nearby at the time.“Someone must have seen or heard something, so we are appealing for anyone with even the smallest bit of information to come and tell us what they know.”The area around the crime scene, just outside Manchester city centre, is widely covered by CCTV, which detectives will now examine to seek possible suspects.Anyone with information has been asked to call GMP’s major incident team on 0161 856 8797, or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
