A teenager who killed the pensioner Richard Mannington Bowes during the London riots can be named as Darrell Desuze after an order banning his identification was lifted.The 17-year-old had been protected because of his age but a judge removed the order at Inner London crown court on Tuesday a day after he admitted manslaughter.Desuze, of Bath Road, Hounslow, punched Mannington Bowes to the ground on 8 August last year during rioting in Ealing, west London.Mannington Bowes, who had been trying to put out a fire in a dustbin near his home, suffered brain damage when his head hit the pavement.He died three days later in hospital.Desuze admitted manslaughter when he appeared in court on Monday.He also pleaded guilty to violent disorder and had previously admitted burglary at William Hill, Tesco Express, Blockbusters and Fatboys Thai restaurant on 8 August.Mr Justice Saunders said that, in terms of consequences, it was the most serious crime committed during the riots and the public had a right to know what had happened and who had killed Mannington Bowes, a retired accountant.Desuze, who a year before the riots had enjoyed a school trip to the Metropolitan police's riot training centre in Gravesend where he watched a simulated riot with officers pelted with bricks, still faces a charge of murder but the Crown will not pursue it and it is expected to lie on file.Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said that on the evening of the killing Desuze, known as Smokey, set off for Harrow with friends.But they headed to Ealing after getting a text from someone anticipating trouble there.Desuze, wearing sunglasses and a distinctive top saying "Robbers and Villains", was caught on camera kicking in the glass doors of a shopping centre before joining a mob that attacked heavily outnumbered police with missiles around Spring Bridge Road."But one thing distinguished him from the others," said Altman. "He killed Richard Bowes, an entirely innocent local resident who had intervened to extinguish flames and prevent a fire in one of the bins."The barrister said left-handed Desuze threw his full weight behind a punch to Mannington Bowes's jaw, buckling his legs, knocking him unconscious and backwards where his head took the full force of impact on the road.The police were "simply unable to reach Mr Bowes for some minutes because of the violence against them", said Altman.After walking off, Desuze returned to the victim and moved him on to the pavement."If it was concern for what he had done, it was short-lived," said Altman."Instead of calling an ambulance or summoning any of the policemen around he was in minutes rejoining the riot."Mannington Bowes sustained "catastrophic brain injuries" and never regained consciousness.Altman said Desuze, who was just 16 at the time, left the scene and within 10 minutes of delivering the fatal blow was breaking into the William Hill, Tesco Express, Blockbusters and Thai restaurant.As officers and members of the public battled to save Mannington Bowes, who was breathing but unresponsive and bleeding, thugs continued to shower them with debris, the court heard.Altman said the prosecution accepted Desuze's guilty plea only on a "full facts" basis. He said he would not accept it if Desuze continued with his "belatedly" offered explanation â€“ that he was provoked and was acting in self-defence.Desuze's mother, Lavinia Desuze, 31, will stand trial next Monday accused of perverting the course of justice by destroying the clothes he wore on the night.Desuze will be sentenced next month after pre-sentencing reports have been completed.
