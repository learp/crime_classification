New evidence uncovered by the family of Stephen Lawrence , the black teenager stabbed to death in south-east London last year, is insufficient to support murder charges, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday. Stephen's family reacted angrily last night and said they were considering bringing a private prosecution against three youths they suspect were involved in the killing.  Stephen, an 18-year-old A level student who wanted to be an architect, died a year ago after he was surrounded by a gang of white youths at a bus stop in Eltham. They taunted him with racist abuse before stabbing him several times.  Two youths aged 16 and 17 were charged with murder but were later released after the CPS said there was a lack of evidence.  The inquest was halted in December after Michael Mansfield, QC, for the family, said 'dramatic' new evidence had been unearthed including information identifying three new suspects.  But a spokeswoman for the prosecution service said that after studying a police report it had decided against pressing charges.  She said: 'Despite the police's painstaking and thorough investigation, we concluded that on the basis of the information available there is insufficient evidence to take action against any individual.'  Doreen Lawrence, Stephen's mother, said she believed the police had failed to carry out a proper investigation.  Scotland Yard said up to 3,000 people had been interviewed and more than 1,000 lines of inquiry pursued.  Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden, leading the inquiry, said: 'We have a great deal of sympathy with the Lawrence family and share their frustration that this case has not yet been brought to a successful conclusion.'
