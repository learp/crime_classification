High-profile teenage killings over the past 12 months have pushed knife crime to the top of the political agenda, but the true scale of the problem is difficult to assess. The Home Office will only begin to record knife crime separately from July, so the picture is unclear. The British Crime Survey, based on the crime experiences of 40,000 people each year, suggests the problem has not worsened over the past 10 years.It suggests 8% of all violent incidents involve knives, a rate that has remained fixed for a decade or more. Robberies involving knives have fallen steadily during the same period.But Home Office statistics show the number of murders involving a "sharp instrument" increased from 197 in 1996 to 258 in 2006-07. In London, 27 teenagers were murdered last year and 13 have been killed so far this year. Boris Johnson, London's mayor, made the fight against teenage violence a central plank of his campaign. Yesterday, in the wake of the most recent killing, he held a meeting with senior police officers and mayoral advisers. The focus on knife crime comes as new guidelines for magistrates suggested some knife offenders could be punished with a fine rather than prison.
