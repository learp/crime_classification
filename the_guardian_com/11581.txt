The former Labour MP David Chaytor faces prison today when he is sentenced for making false parliamentary expenses claims.The 61-year-old became the first politician to be convicted over the expenses scandal when he pleaded guilty last month to three counts of false accounting totalling £18,350.One of the charges relates to £5,425 he falsely claimed between September 2007 and January 2008 for renting a house owned by his mother in Castle Street, Bury, Lancashire.He admitted he did not pay her and would not have been allowed to claim for leasing a property from a family member.His mother, who was in a home and suffering from Alzheimer's disease at the time, has since died.Chaytor also admitted making false claims for £12,925 between November 2005 and September 2006 for renting a flat in Regency Street, near Westminster, central London, which it turned out he owned. A fake tenancy agreement said he was paying £1,175 a month in rent.The third charge relates to falsely charging £1,950 for IT support services in May 2006, although the money was never paid to the former MP.The charge said Chaytor supplied two invoices from a man named Paul France "when in fact the services had not been provided or charged for".Chaytor, of Todmorden, West Yorkshire, initially denied the charges, but changed his plea at the Old Bailey on 3 December ahead of a trial.He was released on bail to be sentenced at Southwark crown court, in London.Chaytor, a former lecturer who is married with three children, faces up to seven years in prison, but his guilty pleas mean the judge can reduce his sentence by one-third.He was first elected as the MP for Bury North in 1997, but was suspended from the parliamentary Labour party after the expenses scandal broke in 2009.He had claimed he should not be prosecuted because of parliamentary privilege, but this claim was rejected by the supreme court.At the earlier hearing, his QC, James Sturman, told the judge, Mr Justice Saunders: "There are many misconceptions about the case which we will wish to put right on 7 January."Obviously he accepts this is a serious matter. There is no loss to the public purse. Any sums claimed have been, or will be, repaid." Sturman said £13,000 had already been paid back.The barrister asked for a pre-sentence report and said he expected to call character witnesses during the sentencing hearing.He said there had so far been "a total failure to reflect that his case reflects appropriate claims gone about in the wrong way"."There was some entitlement in his case, but he did it in such a way which he concedes by his plea of guilty," Sturman said.Hundreds of MPs were ordered to repay a total of £1.12m in the wake of the expenses scandal.Others due to face separate, unconnected trials involving their expenses are the former Scunthorpe Labour MP Elliot Morley, the former Labour MP for Livingston Jim Devine, the former Barnsley Central Labour MP Eric Illsley, the Tory peer Lord Hanningfield and Lord Taylor of Warwick, a former Tory peer.The House of Commons budget officer Andrew Gibson, 49, was jailed for nine months in September last year for siphoning off nearly £6,000 in fake MPs' expenses.
