A police officer alleged to have told an arrested teenager he would "smash his Arab face in" has been suspended pending a standards investigation, Scotland Yard said today.The constable, 26, is accused of abusing a Kurdish teenager who claimed to have captured a tirade of abuse on the voice recorder of his mobile phone.Details of the exchange, which took place in a police van following the boy's arrest in February, emerged during a court hearing in London.West London youth court heard the two-and-a-half minute recording, in which the officer is alleged to have threatened violence, sworn 18 times and accused the teenager of being a robber and a rapist.The district judge, David Simpson, discontinued an allegation of threatening behaviour against the youth, who cannot be named, and called on police to hold an inquiry.He told the court last Friday: "There's a lot of talk about respect and the lack of it. Respect is not something you get by putting on a uniform. I believe respect should be earned."A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "A 26-year-old territorial support group officer based at Paddington was suspended from duty on May 17 pending a Directorate of Professional Standards investigation. This follows an allegation of racial harassment."The youth, who is understood to fear reprisals if he is identified, is from Bayswater and was stopped by police on a street in west London.He has lived in Britain since his childhood and is now a UK citizen after his mother claimed asylum. The boy, thought to be 16, is also known to local authorities.In the recording, the suspended officer is alleged to have said: "If you say one more fucking word, I'll smash your fucking Arab face in. Do you understand?"The constable is said to have called the suspect a rapist and added: "You won't swear at me again, sunshine, and this is one that you won't fucking get off of at court, because I'll write it up properly."
