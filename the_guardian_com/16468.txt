A man appeared in court today charged in connection with a series of alleged bomb threats earlier this month, which forced the temporary closure of 14 Tesco supermarkets.Philip McHugh, an unemployed man from Clitheroe, Lancashire, was remanded in custody until August 8 at Stevenage Magistrates Court in Hertfordshire.He was charged last night with two offences of blackmail and two of making bomb hoaxes, a Hertfordshire police spokesman said. "There is no one else being sought in relation to this offence," the spokesman added. The 51-year-old was arrested after inquiries were made by the Hertfordshire force, in conjunction with other police forces, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Food Standards Agency.Hertfordshire police led the inquiry, as Tesco's headquarters is located in the county.On July 14, the 14 Tesco stores around the country shut after reports of bomb threats against the supermarket giant. They were reopened following searches of the supermarkets themselves and surrounding car parks, shops and access roads.Stores in Lancashire, Suffolk, Dyfed Powys in Wales, Fife and Strathclyde in Scotland, Leicestershire, Humberside, West Mercia, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and London were affected.
