The police complaints authority has launched an investigation into how a man died in police custody less than an hour after he was arrested for drink driving.John Hinde, 43, from Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, was speeding on the M60 in south Manchester when he was pulled over by two Greater Manchester traffic officers. Mr Hinde stepped out of his Volkswagen for a breath test. He registered as over the alcohol limit and was arrested. But he struggled with the officers who attempted to restrain him. Within minutes he had collapsed and within an hour he was pronounced dead at Wythenshawe hospital. A postmortem examination has failed to establish the cause of death. Police hope toxicology test results expected this week will explain Mr Hinde's collapse. Duncan Gear, who is heading the PCA investigation, said: "At this stage, there is no indication that the use of force by police officers was a contributory factor." The PCA is allowing Greater Manchester police to conduct its own investigation under supervision. But if evidence of wrongdoing emerges, an outside force will be called in.
