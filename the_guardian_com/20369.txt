A man previously cleared 15 years ago of murdering a young mother was jailed for life yesterday under changes to the double jeopardy law.William Dunlop stood trial twice for the murder of Julie Hogg, a 22-year-old pizza delivery woman in Teesside, but was formally acquitted after both juries failed to reach a verdict.Ms Hogg's mother, Ann Ming, who had waged a 15-year campaign for the law to be changed, was in court to hear Dunlop be told he would serve a minimum term of 17 years for the 1989 killing.The case made legal history last month when Dunlop, 43, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to murder. While in jail for another assault he had confessed in 1999 to a prison officer, boasting that there was nothing anyone could do about it. The following year he was jailed for six years for perjury, but until the double jeopardy law was changed last year, no one who had been acquitted once could be tried again for the same offence.Ms Hogg's disappearance in November 1989 was treated as a missing person inquiry until 80 days later, when her mother found her decomposing and partially mutilated body behind a bath panel.Mrs Ming and her husband, Charlie, 81, travelled to London from Teesside to see Dunlop jailed. She sobbed as the prosecutor, Andrew Robertson QC, described her daughter's injuries.He said: "The overwhelming inference is that the deceased rejected him and was subjected to a violent sexual assault."Mr Robertson had told the court: "Now the law has changed, in large part due to the long and persistent campaign by Mr and Mrs Ming, who felt they and their daughter were being denied justice."In her impact statement, read to the judge, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, Mrs Ming said the shock and after-effects of finding the body after police had failed to discover it during a search "verges on the indescribable"."To this day, I can still smell the putrefied smell which was our daughter," she said. "As a family, we are damaged beyond repair and will never be the same again as Julie will never return home."The love we feel for Julie means it is we who are serving the life sentence."Ms Hogg, who was separated from her husband, had a son, Kevin, who was three when she was murdered.He was not in court today but his impact statement described how his grandparents had tried to shield him from the truth by telling him his mother had died in the bath. He only discovered what happened when he was 13 and was taunted by other children at school.Mr Justice Calvert-Smith said: "It is impossible to comprehend the shock and horror felt by her mother as she pulled away the panel and discovered her remains." He said there were signs of sexual degradation to the body.The judge said he could not take into account violent crimes committed by Dunlop since the murder, but they would be considered by the Parole Board, which would eventually decide when he would be released. He must serve 17 years before release is considered, but could remain in custody longer if the board thinks him a danger to society.Mrs Ming said after the sentencing: "I would have liked life to have meant life. Julie's murder has devastated our family and left us in turmoil."
