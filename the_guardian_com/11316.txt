Hazel Blears, the Blairite Home Office minister, was jeered by police officers yesterday when she defended the use of civilian patrol officers, at the Police Federation annual conference in Bournemouth.Constables and other rank and file officers barracked her sporadically for 10 minutes over their concern at the increasing use of community support officers or CSOs - civilians referred to by critics as "plastic policemen" and "Blunkett's bouncers". Des Kennoy, a Met constable delegate, told Ms Blears, the minister responsible for policing: "All the people in my branch would say you never shut up - there is such a thing as death by patronising." Ms Blears dismissed Mr Kennoy's comment as "one of the most patronising ... I've heard for a long time". CSOs, of whom there are 3,500 in England and Wales, were introduced in 2002. They are not sworn officers, but have the power to detain a member of the public for 30 minutes. Police argued that they were a false economy.
