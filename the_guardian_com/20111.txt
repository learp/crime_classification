Four council workers accused of being Peeping Toms by allegedly using CCTV cameras to spy on a woman appeared in court today charged with voyeurism. It is claimed that the men, who worked for Sefton Council in Merseyside, pointed a street safety camera into the woman's flat. At the time of the incident, in November last year, the men were employed in the council's CCTV operation centre in Bootle. Kevin Judge, 42, Vincent Broderick, 52, David Welsh, 40, and Mark Summerton, 37, all from Merseyside, are charged with voyeurism and misconduct in a public office. Summerton and Broderick also face a further charge of attempted voyeurism on a separate occasion. The men appeared before South Sefton Magistrates today. None entered pleas but their solicitors indicated they would deny the offences. The case was adjourned for a preliminary hearing at Liverpool Crown Court on June 14. They were all given unconditional bail.Sefton Council has 70 cameras in Bootle, Waterloo, Crosby, Litherland, Netherton, Aintree and Southport. The exact location of the cameras in question has not been revealed.
