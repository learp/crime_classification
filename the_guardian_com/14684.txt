A mother and father have been jailed for giving their toddler son a fatal dose of the heroin substitute methadone to pacify him. Drug addicts Jamie Green and Sonia Britton administered methadone to their son, Jayden-Lee Green, for up to eight months before he died at the age of 23 months.Green, 33, and Britton, 35, did not find their son's lifeless body for at least five hours because they were "groggy" and "hungover" after taking drugs and vodka.Green was jailed for nine years for manslaughter while Britton was imprisoned for four years after being convicted of giving her son methadone and allowing him to die.Jailing Green, Mr Justice Parker told him: "There were times when Jayden's needs were simply too much for you. Jayden had to be pacified, quickly and efficiently. The answer was to feed him a dribble of methadone so that you could have the rest and tranquillity that you wanted."The judge said it was impossible to know if in the end one large dose of methadone had killed the boy or if he had been "drip-fed" over time until his body could no longer cope.Turning to Britton, the judge added: "You were his mother and you knew what was happening. You did nothing. You will have a prolonged anguish for failing to protect your small boy."The jury at Bristol crown court heard tests on the boy's body established levels of the drug similar to that of an adult on a methadone programme, suggesting repeated exposure over a long period.William Mousley, prosecuting, told the jury that the methadone had been prescribed to Green and Britton and was kept on top of a kitchen cupboard, out the reach of any child.He said: "It must have been given to him by an adult and only Sonia Britton and Jamie Green were in a position to do so." The prosecutor added: "While each of them cared about Jayden-Lee, he was not their priority. They were drug addicts whose need for drugs came before Jayden-Lee."When he was found at the couple's one-bedroomed flat in Bristol, the toddler had filthy legs, was wearing a soiled nappy and had methadone stains on his vest.
