Rank and file police leaders yesterday reacted with scepticism to proposals to introduce hand-held computers for patrolling constables and "virtual courts" as part of a drive to cut bureaucracy.Jan Berry, chairman of the Police Federation, predicted that without cash and political will many of the recommendations made by Sir Ronnie Flanagan in his interim report on the future of policing would fail to become a reality.Sir Ronnie, who is the chief inspector of constabulary, identified a "culture of risk aversion" within the police that had generated a "staggering burden" of paperwork, often on the basis of the just-in-case principle, with officers afraid to use their own judgment.He says each of the 43 forces have their own forms, and cites a 44-page booklet to be completed in the case of a traffic collision in one force and a 28-page booklet in another to report a missing person. He defends the use of controversial stop and account forms introduced in the wake of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, saying they provide useful information, but suggests they need to be better managed. One force told him it had produced 79,000 stop and account forms last year with an estimated 25 minutes spent on each form. He calls for a standardised national system of forms alongside technological solutions, such as hand-held computers issued to all mobile patrols and virtual courts with video links between police station custody suites and magistrates courts.The interim report suggests the recent practice of the police investigating a "vast swath of minor crime" needs to be reconsidered. He says the unintended consequence of some targets on detections is police time being spent on low-level common assaults.But he stresses that the Home Office needs to provide clear national leadership to overcome the risk averse culture by finding ways to persuade officers to exercise their own professional judgment.Sir Ronnie was asked to review the future of policing in the face of Downing Street concern that the 77% increase in funding -Â£4.8bn extra - since 1997 has not been matched by increasing productivity.The former RUC chief constable also indicates his final report later this year will look at ways in which the police could generate more income from private sources.The report questions the commitment of the police to the government's drive to put a neighbourhood policing team into every area by next April. Sir Ronnie says he found evidence of neighbourhood officers being repeatedly moved to other duties and says their introduction demands a cultural change across the service.Gordon Brown and the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said they would look at the urgent introduction of hand-held computers and virtual courts.
