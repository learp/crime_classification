The former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans should be allowed to resume his career when he is released from prison, according to Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association.Evans, 25, was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room, but is due to be released having served half his five-year sentence.Over 98,000 people have signed a petition calling on Sheffield United not to re-sign the player after it emerged that the club, who paid £3m to sign him from Manchester City in 2009, had maintained contact with him. United said the contact was “part of its ongoing policy of providing a duty of care to former employees and their families”.Taylor, speaking to the BBC, said Evans, who has always maintained his innocence, does deserve a chance to make a fresh start: “I didn’t know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still can’t do anything.“As a trade union we believe in the rule of law … besides that, he still wants to contribute to society. If he earns money he’ll pay taxes, those taxes will go to help people who maybe can’t get a job.”The director of communications for Rape Crisis England and Wales, Katie Russell, told the BBC the charity hoped “football would seize the chance to send a strong message condemning sexual violence against women.“Obviously Rape Crisis completely supports and recognises the right of any convicted criminal to return to work after they’ve completed their sentence, that’s not something we’re disputing.“But we have to accept that in this case it is an incredibly high-profile figure who will inevitably return … where he will be highly paid, he will get a lot of profile and will be celebrated of course for his sporting prowess.“We would say that the responsibility is really with the clubs and the football authority more widely to send a very strong message that rape and sexual violence – and violence against women and girls more broadly – will not be tolerated within football.”
