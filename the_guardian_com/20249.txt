Two carjackers rammed into the back of a millionaire businessman's Mercedes before spraying him in the face with a chemical and making off with the Â£70,000 car.Daniel Harris, 42, the chief executive of the electronics groups Alba, was left temporarily blind in one eye in the attack while he was driving in Beckton, east London, just before 6pm on Monday. As he approached a roundabout at the A13 junction with the north circular a silver Ford Sierra crashed into him from behind. When Mr Harris, from Radlett, Hertfordshire, pulled over and got out, the passenger from the Sierra jumped out and clambered into the driver's seat of the Mercedes. Mr Harris ran back to the side of the car in an attempt to grab his mobile phone, but the carjacker threatened to kill him. As Mr Harris backed away, the second man jumped out of the Sierra, ran towards the victim and sprayed what police described as a "noxious substance" in his face. The suspects then escaped in the two cars. Mr Harris was left temporarily blinded but did not need hospital treatment. A spokesman said his eyesight would be restored within a week. Police are concerned that this incident was carried out in a similar method to other recent carjackings in London and the south-east but they said they were not linking it specifically to any other incident. Police were still looking for the car.
