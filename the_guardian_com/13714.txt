Incidents of self-harm among prisoners in England and Wales have increased fivefold since 1998, new figures reveal.The figures, provided to Lord Lester QC in response to a question he asked in the House of Lords, show that in 1998 there were 3,207 recorded incidents of self-harm among prisoners. By 2003 there were 14,953. The Prison Service confirmed the figures. A spokeswoman said part of the increase was due to improved reporting techniques put in place in December 2002. Before that reports did not separate accident from deliberate harm. Staff have been encouraged to report cases and establish causes. "The service is aware that 80% of all prisoners have some form of mental problem," she said. She also confirmed that the rate of self-harm among female prisoners had increased "astronomically". The figures prompted strong reactions from mental health and prison organisations. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: "We've lost 50,000 psychiatric beds over 20 years. There is literally nowhere for people to go when they have mental breakdowns and quite often that leads them to prison, often for minor offences." For many desperate people, self-harm was a way to "release their mental pain", she said. Another mental health charity, Mind, said prisons were also to blame. "People identified as having severe mental health problems should not be in prison and there should be more adequate systems in place to divert these people away from custodial care," a spokeswoman said.
