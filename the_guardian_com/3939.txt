A 15-year-old boy will appear in court in Edinburgh today charged with murdering Jodi Jones, a Midlothian teenager who went missing last year.The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested early yesterday at a house in the Dalkeith area. His mother was also arrested and questioned by police.Last night Lothian and Borders police said a 45-year-old woman was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice. She was released but was to be the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal.It is understood the woman is the boy's mother.Jodi, 14, went missing on June 30 last year after leaving her home in the village of Easthouses, near Edinburgh, to visit her boyfriend. A search was launched when she did not return and her body was later found on the Roman Dyke pathway in Dalkeith by friends and family. Police said at the time she had been stabbed to death in a "vicious and frenzied" attack.The killing of the popular teenager launched one of Scotland's biggest murder hunts. Dozens of extra officers were drafted in to help with the inquiry and senior officers flew to the US to seek FBI help on suspect profiling.Detectives spoke to more than 3,000 people in the first month of the inquiry and worried parents were urged to get personal attack alarms for their children.On the day of the funeral, hundreds of Jodi's classmates at St David's high school lined the streets.The 15-year-old charged over Jodi's death is expected to appear at Edinburgh sheriff court today.
