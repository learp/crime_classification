New research reveals that Britons spend an estimated £1bn a year buying goods from unlicensed traders in public houses, and they don't care where it has come from, as long as the price is right.Around 12% of the population, or an estimated 5.6 million Britons, has bought knock-down goods in the pub, the research suggests, the most popular purchases being household items like DVDs and videos, followed by clothing, consumer electrical items, mobile phones and jewellery. Men are more likely than women to buy goods of unknown provenance in a pub, with 17% surveyed having done so, compared with 8% of women. Men also pay more, spending on average £202 on pub purchases over a lifetime, compared with £95 by women.The findings of a survey of more than 1,000 people reveal a relaxed attitude towards this kind of black market trading, with people either not asking or not caring where the goods have come from. The survey revealed that an estimated 3.7 million Britons would knowingly buy stolen goods in a public house, and 52% of those surveyed would not be deterred if the goods appeared to have come from someone's home. Nearly half (49%) said they would not report to police someone they believed was selling stolen goods.Martin Gill, a professor of criminology at the University of Leicester, said the findings, commissioned by Halifax Home Insurance, are in keeping with his own research. "I've done a lot of work with offenders looking at how they steal goods and what they then do with them," he said. "They say they are very easy to sell on because people are not bothered with where they have come from."Prof Gill believes Britain needs a public education campaign to bring home the ramifications of buying illicit goods. "It's not seen as a big deal ... but there are good reasons why we shouldn't buy stolen goods," he said. People who do are fuelling theft, he said, as well as contributing to the addiction problems that cause many people to steal.
