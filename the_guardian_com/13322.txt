A blind householder who fatally knifed a man he found urinating in his garden will not be charged with murder.Thomas O'Connor, 62, was arrested after twice stabbing Lee Kelso, 23, at his home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in June.He was remanded on police bail after telling detectives that he had acted in self-defence. The police and the crown prosecution service have now decided that he should not be prosecuted.But he and his wife, Erith, 61, have been forced to go into hiding by a firebomb attack on their home. Their children and grandchildren have also moved from the area.The police have played down parallels with the case of Tony Martin, jailed for shooting dead a burglar he found at his Norfolk farmhouse. Detective Chief Inspector Ian Foster said: "This decision refers to this case specifically and should not be taken as an indication that people can take the law into their own hands."The force issued a statement yesterday in an attempt to clarify how Kelso died. It made it clear that he had forced his way inside the house and was stabbed there.The police said that after spending seven hours in a pub Kelso stopped at the house. The couple were woken and Mr O'Connor went to the window to tell the intruder to leave."Mr Kelso threatened the occupants and tried to break into their home.He kicked the front door and the occupants tried to call the police but misdialled. Mr O'Connor came downstairs and as he went into the living room and got a knife, the front door split open and came off its hinges, and Lee Kelso came into the doorway."A violent encounter then occurred, the elderly couple were assaulted, and Mr Kelso was stabbed twice."He died later in hospital.
