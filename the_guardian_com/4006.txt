A married couple were cleared today of poisoning a toddler they hoped to adopt.The couple, who were facing a retrial after the court of appeal quashed their original conviction, were accused of giving three-year-old Christian Blewitt an overdose of salt.Christian was five weeks into a 13-week trial adoption with Ian and Angela Gay when he collapsed at their then home, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in December 2002.After four days in intensive care, he died at Birmingham children's hospital. Tests showed an abnormally high level of sodium in his blood.The prosecution claimed the couple had force-fed him up to six teaspoons of salt as a punishment for being naughty.But the jury of eight women and four men sitting at Nottingham crown court cleared the couple of manslaughter after hearing from expert witnesses that Christian may have suffered from a rare medical condition that meant his body retained sodium.The couple were also cleared of a second charge, of cruelty.During the six-week trial, the court heard that on December 8 2002 Christian had fallen ill. In police interviews after Christian's death, Mr Gay, 39, said the three-year-old had been misbehaving, refusing to eat his lunch.The couple left him alone as they thought he was simply seeking attention but soon heard a crash and discovered Christian had thrown his lunch on the floor.Ian Gay told police he had thought Christian was laughing at him, and put him to bed as a punishment.Later, the Gays found Christian comatose in the bedroom and took him to Russells Hall hospital in Dudley. He was unresponsive, and doctors immediately put him in intensive care.He was transferred to Birmingham children's hospital, where his condition deteriorated. Life support was withdrawn four days later.Tests revealed the high sodium levels, and a postmortem examination showed 11 separate areas of bruising on the top of his head. The prosecution accused the couple of manhandling the boy by shaking him or throwing him on to a mattress. The Gays had not intended to kill Christian or to cause him really serious harm, the prosecution said, but any reasonable person in their position would have realised that their actions would cause harm.This was the second time Mr and Mrs Gay were tried in connection with Christian's death. In 2005, a jury at Worcester crown court cleared them of the toddler's murder but found them guilty of his manslaughter.After 15 months in jail, the couple were freed. The court of appeal overturned their convictions and ordered a retrial after hearing new medical evidence that suggested Christian may have suffered from a rare condition know as a reset osmostat, which causes the body to retain sodium.Dr Glyn Walters, a consultant chemical pathologist, told the court of appeal and the jury in this trial that this condition would explain the level of sodium in Christian's body.
