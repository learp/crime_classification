Inspectors raised concerns with Haringey council's social care services months before the death of Baby P, it was revealed today.An area review by Ofsted and the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) highlighted a series of "issues for improvement" at the north London authority.The latest details emerged as Gordon Brown, speaking in the US before meeting G20 leaders, said he would "do everything in my power" to ensure there was no repeat of the Baby P tragedy. The 17-month-old died in August last year.The CSCI's concerns included Haringey council's safeguarding procedures.In a statement, the CSCI said: "These issues were raised with the council. Haringey was told to resolve these issues as soon as possible."The inspectorate added that it had investigated the fears of a whistleblower, Nevres Kemal, about the council's alleged failure to act on sexual abuse allegations.It said it had been satisfied that the council had "dealt properly" with the individual case."We raised these issues directly with Haringey at a formal meeting on 12 March 2007 and were satisfied that the council had dealt properly with the individual case raised [by the whistleblower]," the CSCI said.Earlier, the government was accused of "bureaucratic buck passing" by the Conservatives after it emerged that Kemal, a Haringey social worker, and her lawyers had written to ministers about the concerns.Kemal wrote to the then health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, before she received an injunction preventing her from speaking publicly about her claims.Kemal's lawyers also wrote to junior health ministers Rosie Winterton and Ivan Lewis, and the local MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, who was a culture minister at the time.Kemal said that children from a 2004 case were returned to a home where they had been abused.The Daily Mail said she warned the ministers that there was a risk of a repeat of the case of Victoria Climbié, the eight-year-old girl who was murdered in Haringey in 2000.Kemal's lawyer, Lawrence Davies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the complaint "got pushed from pillar to post".Downing Street denied "buck passing" between departments."There is an appropriate body for complaints regarding social care," a spokesman said."It is right that complaints should be directed to the Commission for Social Care Inspection to take appropriate action."The shadow children's secretary, Michael Gove, demanded a "proper explanation" of what steps were taken."The public are tired of hearing that 'correct procedures have been followed' when a child died in agony," he said. "Ministers were told six months before Baby P's death that there were profound problems in Haringey's children's services department."In February last year, Kemal won an employment tribunal against Haringey council in which she claimed she was suspended by the authority because of her whistleblowing.Haringey council apologised yesterday for not doing more to protect Baby P.Liz Santry, the cabinet member for children and young people, who has faced calls for her resignation, said she was "truly sorry that we did not do more". But in a further development today, it emerged that Santry sent an email to all other Haringey councillors, just 10 days after Baby P's death, criticising the media for linking the tragedy to the Climbié murder."The press has covered the case this weekend and of course has chosen to link it with events from the past. As you are all aware much has changed since these events," she said.
