It was the trial of Michael Brewer in 2013 that exposed the dark secret of abuse at some of the UK’s most prestigious music schools. Brewer, a former head of music at Chetham’s in Manchester, was found guilty of indecently assaulting a pupil who was 14 at the time. His victim, Frances Andrade, a gifted violinist, killed herself after giving evidence against him, before he was sentenced to six years in jail.The trial at Manchester crown court led to an investigation by Greater Manchester police, codenamed Operation Kiso. Two more music teachers linked to Chetham’s and the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) have been convicted of abusing students. A further two are due to stand trial later this year.Guildhall music teacher Philip Pickett jailed for raping female students In September last year, Nicholas Smith, 66, a conductor, was sentenced to eight months in prison after admitting sexually assaulting a 15-year-old Chetham’s pupil at his holiday cottage in Buxton in the 1970s. His victim was a contemporary of Andrade at Chetham’s and came forward to police after hearing of her suicide. The judge told Smith he was guilty of “a gross breach of trust”.In November Duncan McTier, 59, a double bass teacher, pleaded guilty at Liverpool crown court to two counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted indecent assault against young women from RNCM in Manchester and Purcell school in Hertfordshire in the 1980s and 1990s.Handing down a three-month sentence suspended for two years, the judge told McTier: “It was a long time ago but that behaviour, as you know, was shameful and horrid for somebody who had the trust of students and took advantage of your position or tried to take advantage of your position because you could influence their potential careers and that is what makes it the more serious.”In June Malcolm Layfield, who resigned as head of strings at the RNCM in 2013, is due to stand trial accused of raping one of his students from Chetham’s when she was 18. He denies the charge.Also due to stand trial in June is Wen Zhou Li, a Chinese-born violin teacher, who denies one count of rape and two counts of indecent assault of a teenage pupil at Chetham’s between March 1996 and May 1997.
