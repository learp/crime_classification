At around 2.15pm on Saturday 26 April 2014 the victim was cycling along St Mary's Road when a blue estate car drove intentionally into the back of him, slamming him to the ground. CCTV footage showed how the man's bike became stuck under the car, which reversed and then drove back over the bike at speed as it made a getaway. The cyclist suffered injuries to his leg, arm and back in the crash, while the bike was subjected to extensive damage. According to Greater Manchester police, the driver of the car was a white man in a baseball cap. Detective constable Darren Byrne said: "This was a deliberate, shocking attack against an innocent man, who was lucky to escape more serious injury. "We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the incident, or perhaps even the car in question, which in this case was used as a weapon by the offender. "We hope that this appeal and the CCTV footage of the event will jog someone's memory and help us track down the perpetrator of this seemingly random attack."
