A teenager who raped a woman in her home and forced her flatmate to join in the abuse was caught by his palm print 25 years later, a court heard today.Robert Clarke, now 42, was 16 when it is alleged that he broke into the house in south London wearing a balaclava and used a iron bar to force the woman and her male flatmate to undress.He then forced them into sexual situations and abused both, before raping the woman twice, ransacking the home and escaping through the bedroom window, Southwark crown court was told.Clarke was arrested last September when Scotland Yard's cold case rape unit reopened the file and found a match between his palm print and that of one left on a windowsill in the flat.Lisa Wilding, prosecuting, said the victims did not know each other well but were renting rooms in a property in West Norwood, south London, when the attack happened.In August 1984, the flatmates were watching television in the living room at about 10.30pm when Clarke walked in through the front door wearing socks over his hands and a blue balaclava on his head and carrying an iron bar, the court heard.He ordered the flatmates to undress; he then raped the woman twice, indecently assaulted her flatmate and forced him to abuse her too, jurors were told. The defendant then tied both of them up with cables, flexes and chain, and fled through the window."He stood on the ledge and in a parting shot said 'Thank you for the business,'" Wilding said.Explaining why the crime had taken 26 years to come to court, Wilding told the jury fingerprint evidence was key to the whole case."In 1984 the trail ran cold and it was not possible to trace the assailant. But scenes of crimes officers took finger print evidence which included a palm print from the inside of the window."The system then was far less organised and it was not computerised but there now exists the cold case rape unit and in September 2009 checks were made on old unsolved finger prints."This defendant's palm print was held on the central database and a match was revealed. This is how it comes before the court so many years later. The technology was not available, that is until now."Clarke denies two counts of rape, two of indecent assault, one of aggravated burglary, one of incitement to commit indecent assault and one of false imprisonment."This is a case that rests on a single strand of evidence, which is a palm print of the defendant," Wilding told the court."Your role in this case is to decide whether that palm print was left by the man who had just raped and burgled [the pair] or whether there is some innocent explanation that we don't know of yet."The trial continues.
