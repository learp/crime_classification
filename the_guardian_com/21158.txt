A former reservist soldier has been jailed for life after being found guilty of trying to murder his pregnant wife by booby-trapping a car with a hand grenade.A judge said Nicholas Fabian, 33, was "wicked beyond belief" for trying to blow up nurse Victoria Fabian by planting the explosive device in a wheel arch by the driver's footwell.Detectives believe Fabian, who was due to be deployed to Afghanistan, tried to murder his wife so he could set up a new life with his mistress, Jackie Phillips.The explosion happened as Victoria Fabian, also 33, started to drive away in the borrowed Mazda near the family home in Vigo, Kent, on 5 March last year.Her eight-year-old son, who was in the car, managed to get out unscathed while her unborn child also survived unharmed.Victoria Fabian, who was 24 weeks pregnant at the time, eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy three months later.Jurors took just an hour to convict Fabian of attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life.Sentencing him at Maidstone crown court, Judge Andrew Patience QC said he must serve a minimum of 16 years behind bars for the attempted murder conviction. He passed a 15-year concurrent sentence for the explosion charge.The judge told him: "What you did in causing that explosion, with the consequences which flowed from it on 5 March last year, was wicked beyond belief."You conceived a plan to rid yourself of your wife which demonstrated low cunning in its planning and preparation, and utter heartlessness and chilling ruthlessness in its execution."The judge added that what was found in Fabian's shed "showed clearly that explosions were on your mind".He went on: "You are an evil man who was prepared to destroy at least one human life in order to achieve your own selfish ends."Not only are you evil but you present a danger to the general public."Patience said the offences were so serious that they filled the court and the general public with feelings of "utter horror and revulsion".He added: "It was obvious from the time you spent with your mistress that you were obsessed with her and that you wanted a future life with your mistress."Your wife was not to know, even when you were sat together on 4 March, that the plans for your life together meant nothing to you and you were practising upon her the cruellest of deceptions."The judge said it was inevitable that, later in life, his son would find out that he tried to harm him when he was still unborn.Victoria Fabian faces a lifetime of physical pain, the judge added.
