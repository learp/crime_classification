Abigail Witchalls, the young mother who was feared paralysed after being stabbed in the neck and left for dead in April, is beginning to regain feeling in her limbs and can now raise her right arm and move the fingers of her right hand.Pictures released yesterday reveal the remarkable progress Mrs Witchalls, 26, has made in the 10 weeks since her attack. They show her sitting in a wheelchair and smiling. Mrs Witchalls, who is pregnant with her second child, has also recovered her speech and is now able to eat pur√©ed food. She was out walking with her son, Joseph, in the Surrey village of Little Bookham when she was attacked on April 20.
