Britain's police forces are still unable to use a pan-European database of criminals, prompting warnings that this could hinder their ability to track terror suspects entering Europe ahead of the Olympics.The UK was given access to sensitive information on criminal and policing matters held on the Schengen Information System, an EU-wide directory, in 2000, but there have been repeated technical problems. Baroness Ludlow, the Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on home affairs in the European parliament, called the hold-up "absolutely crazy". "The government keeps claiming crime is falling; well, it could do even more to cut crime if it takes advantage of this arrangement," she said.Experts say the database could form a powerful weapon in the fight against crime and terrorism. In the past, Home Office officials have said that connecting British forces to the system had proved impossible due to technical difficulties and "acts of God", such as a fire that destroyed vital IT equipment.The government insists it is keen to sign up to a new, bigger database - SIS II - that will include information provided by eastern European countries. This was due to be implemented in 2007 but, following a legal row with a contractor, the deadline has been pushed back. Ben Hayes, of the privacy campaign group Statewatch, said there were concerns about the database's size and scope - and its use to store allegations as well as proven facts.
