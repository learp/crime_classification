Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, has put on hold a key crime and courts bill in order to "put some bite" into his predecessor Ken Clarke's proposals to reform community punishments.Grayling is to outline his new approach to community punishments in his Conservative party conference speech on Tuesday. He is also expected to indicate that he wants to accelerate the pace of prison and probation privatisation.Justice ministers have conceded that "more competition, more outsourcing, and more payment by results" is now the official way forward. Grayling has said he wants to be "the tough justice secretary" and wants to ensure there is an even greater "punitive element" in the community sentences handed out to 220,000 offenders every year.Clarke published a package to toughen up community sentences, including intensive punishment orders, 24-hour tagging surveillance and compulsory sobriety orders, but they were intended as an alternative to short-term prison sentences which have stubbornly high re-offending rates.The legislation is urgently needed to set up the new national crime agency. But Grayling has now postponed that. "Grayling has ripped up Clarke's proposals for community sentences because he doesn't want to make them an alternative to custody," say probation sources. "He wants to make existing community punishments much tougher with a short community sentence with surveillance and tags."More punitive kinds of community punishments – that were already under consideration before Grayling was appointed – include afternoon curfews, satellite tracking of certain offenders, seizing and selling an offender's assets and property as a punishment in its own right, and a system of fixed penalty on the spot fines for those who fail to comply with their community sentences.The move comes as Napo, the probation union, launches a campaign against the privatisation of the probation service, saying official proposals outlined in July will involve 60% of its work, including core activities, being put out to tender from this autumn. Decisions on the next wave of prison contracts, involving nine jails, worth £170m a year, are to be announced as soon as MPs return to Westminster later this month, with G4S and Serco among the frontrunners.Napo, which launched its campaign at its 100th anniversary conference, warned that privatisation would be a "race to the bottom at the expense of effectiveness and efficiency" and said the obsession with the lowest price was "bound to compromise public protection" with fewer staff, less supervision and less training.Harry Fletcher, Napo's assistant general secretary, pointed to a letter from Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, to all 35 probation chief officers in England and Wales saying the government was "examining the potential for core probation services to be competed". This is believed to include the supervision of some offenders and writing of pre-sentence reports.The supervision of low- and medium-risk offenders has already been handed over to a private company by the decision to award the London contract for community payback schemes, or community service as it used to be known, to Serco in a move said to save £25m.Fletcher said: "The decision to privatise probation flies in the face of all available evidence. All probation areas are performing well: the service won an excellence award and probation programmes reduced reoffending to 35%. This tendering exercise is not about quality, but purely about ideology."A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "We are extending competition to bring innovative, quality services across the criminal justice system to reduce reoffending, provided by those best placed to do so, whether they are in the public, voluntary or private sectors. It is important that the prison competition programme is carefully reviewed by ministers before any decisions or announcements are made."
