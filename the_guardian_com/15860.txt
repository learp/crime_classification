Prisoners who get hold of unauthorised mobile phones while in jail will face prosecution, and a new legal requirement will mean airguns must be stored out of the reach of children under new measures in the crime and security bill.The possession of an unauthorised mobile phone inside prison is already against jail rules but the decision to make it a criminal offence follows mounting concern that some offenders are continuing to operate major drugs rings and other criminal enterprises while behind bars.More than 8,600 smuggled mobile phones or sim cards were found inside jails in England and Wales in the 12 months to June. They included 255 found in high security prisons.One gangster, Delphon Nicholas, was even found guilty last year of orchestrating the execution of a former childhood friend from within Belmarsh maximum security prison in London using a smuggled mobile phone.A justice ministry spokesman said that it was already a criminal offence to smuggle a mobile phone inside, but "the objective of this clause is to act as an additional deterrent to those who consider trafficking a mobile phone and/or its component parts into a prison or to have them in their possession and to punish those that do".The new bill covers a ragbag of anti-crime measures including new rules on the retention of the DNA profiles of the innocent, stronger powers to tackle antisocial behaviour, the scrapping of stop and search forms and the introduction of a licensing regime for private wheelclamping businesses.Its most controversial elements are probably yet to emerge, with a policing white paper to tackle the thorny issue of local police accountability expected to be published shortly. Both Labour and Conservatives are promising to introduce monthly beat meetings for the public in every neighbourhood, but Alan Johnson, the home secretary, has already ruled out the options of an elected police commissioner and elected police authority members.The police white paper is also expected to introduce more measures to cut police red tape arising out of the yet-to-be published review of bureaucracy carried out by Jan Berry, the former chairman of the Police Federation. The bill is already pledged to include powers to reduce the reporting requirements on stop-and-search forms while retaining the ability to monitor the ethnicity of those who are stopped.Johnson, who has made clear his reluctance to introduce more Home Office legislation than is absolutely necessary, will continue to focus on the drive to tackle antisocial behaviour over the next six months. The antisocial behaviour package ensures that a mandatory assessment is carried out on the parents of every child aged 10 to 15 who is considered for an asbo, and that automatic parenting orders are imposed on those whose teenage children breach the asbo.Other possible areas of controversy that have yet to publicly emerge are the future of anti-terror control orders, which the home secretary is pledged to review in the new year, and new measures to tackle violence against women and girls. New powers to bring in domestic violence protection orders or "go orders", which exclude violent men from the family home for 14 days, will be added to the bill. But ministers are also looking at police proposals for a domestic violence register with possible new criminal offences.The bulk of the bill as it stands at present is made up of measures relating to the national DNA database. It will include powers to hold the DNA profiles of innocent people for up to six years, which the Tories will oppose by arguing that the Scottish model of up to five years for serious violent and sexual offences would be sufficient. The bill also includes the power to retrospectively add profiles of those convicted of serious offences before 2004 to the database to enable the police to tackle "cold cases".
