A man who spent 18 years in prison for murdering his heavily pregnant wife despite apparently serious flaws in the case uncovered by miscarriage of justice campaigners, has been released on parole but barred from discussing the matter, according to reports.Eddie Gilfoyle, 49, whose continued imprisonment was highlighted by the Guardian's justice on trial series, among others, was freed from Sudbury open prison in Derbyshire yesterday.However, a condition of his parole is that he does not directly or indirectly contact the media, according to The Times, which has also campaigned for his release.Gilfoyle's wife was found hanged in the garage of their home in Upton, Merseyside, in 1992. Prosecution evidence alleged that it would have been impossible for Paula Gilfoyle, who was eight-and-half months pregnant, to have strung the rope from a beam without assistance, and that her suicide note betrayed signs it had been written with her husband's help.Gilfoyle insisted his innocence throughout. Forensic experts who supported him said it would be almost impossible to hang someone who was conscious against their will without leaving signs of a struggle. Police officers cut down her body before tests were carried out meaning the time of her death could not be established, a crucial part of the case.Despite the apparent gaps in the prosecution case, Gilfoyle lost two appeals.A campaign group supporting Gilfoyle said it could not discuss the specifics of his release but indicated in a statement that his lawyers would appeal against the gagging condition, which reportedly includes his family, supporters and lawyers.It said: "We are not able to provide a response because the parole board has imposed a condition on Eddie's life licence that prohibits him contacting the media either directly or indirectly whether this is regarding his release or his appeal. This is a matter that we will be challenging through the courts but until that time we cannot comment."A spokesman for the parole board said he could not comment on individual cases but said a condition banning prisoners from talking to the media would be imposed to prevent further offending.He said: "Any prisoner who is released is released if we reach a judgment that he is safe to release and that he is not going to go on to commit another offence. It is sometimes the case that one of the licence conditions is that the prisoner being released doesn't get involved with the media. If that is the case, the only reason for that condition would be to prevent further offending."For instance, it might be the case that if a high-profile prisoner talks to the media after he has been released, there would be issues concerning the feelings of the victims."There might be concerns about the reaction of the general public to someone who has been released from a life sentence."
