Britain is moving from the "politics of class to the politics of behaviour" as members of a predominantly poor and white group refuse to accept society's rules and threaten the majority, a leading Labour MP said last night.The breakdown in the social contract caused by "yobbery" was so serious that it might have to be formally recognised, and individuals told both their entitlements and duties, the social policy expert and former minister for welfare reform, Frank Field, argued.In a lecture at Liverpool University to honour Eleanor Rathbone, leader of the non-militant women's suffrage movement, social reformer and independent MP, he argued that the root cause was the growth of dysfunctional families.He called for: A guaranteed £22,000 a year income for all mothers in the "crucial" first two years of a child's life; Promotion of the belief "that children need the active support of two parents and, where possible, grandparents"; An assertion that "though this is not the norm for many families, what is best for children should not be denied for fear of offending political correctness".Likening British citizenship to a train journey which more and more people had joined in the past 150 years, Mr Field said a "mob or rabble is hanging around in an aggressive mood" - not just refusing to buy a ticket, but menacing the passengers they "loathed" on board.Mr Field, who has been MP for Birkenhead since 1979, said that the exceptionally peaceful society that had been created in Britain over the centuries was now under threat.This was because more and more people no longer held three core beliefs: in respectability; in moral character as part of citizenship; and in self and mutual improvement of the kind nurtured by the early Labour movement.Saying that individuals needed to learn within their families, he went on: "If there is a single root cause to the rise and rise of yobbery and anti-social behaviour, it is that an increasing number of families are failing to impart those social skills to their offspring."Before he became an MP, Mr Field was a leading lobbyist for children and the poor, as director of the Child Poverty Action Group from 1969 to 1979, and director of the Low Pay Unit from 1974 to 1980.He was appointed a social services minister to "think the unthinkable" about reform in 1979. But he fell out with his colleagues and was dropped. theguardian.com/crime
