Two young brothers today pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent over an attack on two boys aged nine and 11.The brothers, who were aged 10 and 11 at the time of the attack, which happened in Edlington, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, in April, admitted the charge at Sheffield crown court. The elder boy is now 12.They denied a charge of attempted murder, but the guilty plea to the lesser charge was accepted by the prosecution, which will open the case later today.The brothers were arrested on 4 April after the nine-year-old victim was found wandering in the former pit village covered in blood. His 11-year-old uncle was discovered unconscious in a nearby wooded ravine.Both the injured boys have since been released from hospital.In court today, the brothers also each pleaded guilty to robbing one of the boys of a mobile phone and the other of cash.They also admitted two counts of intentionally causing a child to engage in sexual activity.The brothers were later charged with one count each of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and making a threat to kill in connection with an attack on another 11-year-old boy in Doncaster on 28 March.They denied these charges but each pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.Due to the ages of the boys facing court, special measures were put in place to make sure they did not feel intimidated.The court was cleared as they were brought, in and the judge and barristers did not wear gowns and wigs.The pair were allowed to sit at the back of the court rather than in the dock, with social workers next to them to help explain the proceedings and answer any questions.The judge, Mr Justice Keith, told the brothers they could remain seated as they entered their pleas. They followed the charges on a sheet in front of them as the clerk read out the details.The elder boy, wearing a short-sleeved black shirt and black tie, entered his pleas first and often looked towards his younger brother, who wore a white shirt and black tie, as he subsequently entered his pleas.Both spoke clearly as they entered their pleas.
