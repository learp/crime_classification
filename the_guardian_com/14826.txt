A 28-year-old man has been arrested over the murder of two women in Birmingham. Police said they detained him as he apparently tried to flee the country today.The bodies of the women, both in their early 20s, were found at a flat in Ryland Street, in the Ladywood area of the city, shortly before 5.40pm yesterday.Detective Chief Superintendent Dave Mirfield said: "Both girls had been subjected to a sustained and violent attack. We believe at this stage at least one or more weapons had been used."The man was arrested at 6.30am as he attempted to board a ferry in Dover, Kent, about 170 miles from Birmingham.Police say he is connected to at least one of the women and they are not looking for anyone else. Mirfield said the bodies had not yet been moved from the flat in the Jupiter Apartments, a large, new residential complex near Broad Street, the city's main strip of bars, clubs and restaurants.The apartments had been sealed off for forensic examination. Mirfield said there was a "substantial amount of blood" and described the scene as "particularly challenging forensically". He added there were signs of ransacking but no indication of forced entry.The women were discovered yesterday by the building's concierge after their families raised concerns. Police said they were probably killed at the weekend.Police have contacted next of kin but have not yet named the women. The spokesman said postmortem examinations would be carried out. Relatives were being supported by family liaison officers.
