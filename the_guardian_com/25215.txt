A former labourer who has admitted being the infamous Yorkshire Ripper hoaxer known as Wearside Jack today pleaded guilty to four counts of perverting the course of justice.John Humble, 50, of Flodden Road, Sunderland, taunted detectives by claiming to be the killer in three letters and on an audiotape he sent in the late 1970s. The letters were posted in Sunderland and the voice on the tape had a strong Wearside accent.After receiving the hoax letters and tapes, detectives wasted huge amounts of time and effort when they concentrated on the Sunderland area, searching for a man with the distinctive accent.The tape caused a sensation when George Oldfield, the West Yorkshire police assistant chief constable who led the inquiry, played it to the nation in 1979.Grey-haired Humble stood in the dock wearing a blue sweatshirt and a moustache, flanked by one security guard.He spoke only to enter his four guilty pleas, but his distinctive Sunderland accent could be clearly heard. The pleas related to each of the four counts of perverting the course of justice he faced - one for each of the letters and the fourth relating to the tape.A judge has already heard that Humble admitted sending the hoaxes in 1978 and 1979. Two letters and the tape were sent to Mr Oldfield. The third letter was sent to the Daily Mirror office in Manchester.The claims were shown to be a hoax when Peter Sutcliffe was arrested in 1981 and admitted to having carried out the killings.Humble was arrested last year and was due to go on trial today, until he changed his pleas.Sutcliffe, 59, was jailed for life in 1981 for the murder of 13 women. He killed three of his victims after Humble sent the hoaxes.
