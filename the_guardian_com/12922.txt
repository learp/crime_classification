The organisation set up to strip criminals of their ill-gotten gains has had a workload almost three times bigger than expected in its first year, its annual report revealed yesterday.Police and other law enforcement bodies have given the Assets Recovery Agency 142 cases since its launch in February 2003. Its original target was 50. The ARA, aided by the Proceeds of Crime Act, froze £14.8m in assets in its first 12 months, well ahead of its £10m target.Its staff numbers have risen from 90 to 131, and the budget will be boosted from £14m in the past year to £15.5m in the coming one, although the annual report admitted: "That flow [of work] well exceeds the agency's initial forecasts and plans, as well as the budgets made available to support civil recovery and taxation action." Jane Earl, the ARA's director, said that of the 142 referrals 62 cases were under way and a handful had been turned down because her team felt they would not succeed. She denied that any of the others had been "parked" due to lack of funds or staff, but admitted: "Of course more money would help. There is a direct relationship between the money we have and what we can do." Some criminals manage to evade jail terms, or see them as a mere inconvenience before returning to their wealthy lifestyles, and the government hopes the ARA can hit them where it hurts - in the pocket. But some of the subjects of freezing orders are mounting complex legal challenges, and it will take time for the ARA's work to bear significant fruit. Ms Earl estimates many cases could take as long as two years. The first civil recovery case was only settled last week. However, Ms Earl said things would be easier when legal precedents were established. There were important principles at stake, and in some cases ARA investigators had uncovered important evidence of criminal activity.
