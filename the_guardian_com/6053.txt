Two men have been arrested in connection with an investigation into the disappearance of the multimillionaire fraudster and Liberal Democrat donor Michael Brown, police confirmed on Sunday.City of London police said they had been aware "for some time" that the fugitive had been living under an alias in the Dominican Republic.As part of the force's investigations, two men were arrested in London on Friday on suspicion of assisting an offender. Both have been bailed pending further inquiries.Detective Superintendent Bob Wishart said: "Contrary to some reports in the media, City of London police remain determined to ensure Michael Brown is returned to the UK to face justice and serve his sentence. His victims, and UK law, demand no less."Brown was sentenced in his absence to seven years in prison after being convicted of fraud at Southwark crown court in 2008.He donated about £2.4m to the Lib Dems before the 2005 general election, the party's largest donation to date.An international manhunt was launched when Brown went on the run after stealing nearly £8m from the former chairman of Manchester United. He posed as a highly successful bond dealer and claimed connections with royalty to steal the money from Martin Edwards.He secretly used investors' cash to fund the donation to the Lib Dems, and spent more money on an "extravagant" lifestyle.The Dominican Republic has no extradition treaty with Britain, but City of London police said they were working with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Foreign Office to "seek a lawful means of ensuring Brown is returned to the UK".Charles Kennedy, who was the Lib Dem leader at the time of the donation, said the party had done everything it could to check the windfall was legitimate. He told the BBC: "We were very careful, we always were in the Lib Dems, to keep a distance, a bufferzone, over donations.""I know, or I was told – and I don't doubt the veracity of this at all – that not only were all responsible checks taken before his company made this donation but, indeed, they went the extra mile with the authorities in making checks."A Lib Dem spokesman said: "The Electoral Commission inquiry in 2009 found that the party accepted the donation in good faith, and was in no way at fault."It cleared the party of all wrongdoing and accepted that, at the time of the donation, Michael Brown was a permitted donor."
