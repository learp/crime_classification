The Falkirk MP, Eric Joyce, has been fined Â£1,500 after he admitted using threatening or abusive behaviour at an airport last year.The 53-year-old independent MP pleaded guilty to one charge when he appeared at Edinburgh sheriff court on Friday. The charge related to an incident at Edinburgh airport on 19 May last year.Speaking outside court, Joyce said he would reflect on whether to continue as an MP until the general election in 2015. "My instinct is to stay but I don't know how I will feel in a few days."Joyce apologised to airport staff, police and his constituents."I am very embarrassed that this has happened," he said. "My constituents have seen this before, so they might think other apologies are not meant, but they are."Asked if he had a problem with alcohol, Joyce said he had addressed such issues. "I think I am well past that now."Joyce was a Labour MP until March 2012 when he resigned from the party after pleading guilty to assault.
