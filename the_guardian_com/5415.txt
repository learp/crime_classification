TV entertainer Michael Barrymore was arrested in London today by police investigating the death of Stuart Lubbock, sources said.Essex police said three men were arrested on suspicion of the murder of Mr Lubbock, who was found dead in Mr Barrymore's swimming pool in 2001. They were also questioned over allegations of serious sexual assault. According to sources, Mr Barrymore was one of the men arrested.The other two arrested men were named by sources as Justin Merritt, a dustman from Harlow, and Jonathan Kenny, Mr Barrymore's ex-lover. Police refused to name the three.Mr Lubbock's brother Kevin said today that he was "thrilled" at the arrests.Mr Lubbock, of Harlow, Essex, was found in a swimming pool at Mr Barrymore's home in Roydon, Essex, after a party in March 2001.Essex police also confirmed that they had received tapes of interviews with Mr Barrymore that are believed to contain new information about the death of Mr Lubbock.They were made by his former literary agent Tony Cowell, brother of the X-Factor judge Simon, in preparation for Mr Barrymore's autobiography.A spokesman for the police said that "tapes and other items" had been obtained from Mr Cowell, but would not go into details about what they contained.He added: "The arrests were planned prior to Essex police obtaining those tapes. The arrests are the result of a culmination of work by Essex police over 12 months in the form of a review and investigation."Mr Barrymore accepted a caution for drug offences following the original police inquiry.At an inquest the following year, the coroner recorded an open verdict. A postmortem examination showed Mr Lubbock had suffered severe internal injuries which may have been suggestive of a sexual attack. Ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream.Last year, the police launched a fresh inquiry into Mr Lubbock's death, after the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced an investigation into the way detectives handled the original inquiry.The IPCC said it had suspended its inquiry following the three arrests.Mr Barrymore left Britain for New Zealand in 2003, but he appeared on Channel 4's Celebrity Big Brother in January 2006. He then went back to New Zealand but he returned to Britain a month ago.Karen Kay, his New Zealand-based agent, said in an email to Guardian Unlimited: "I am shocked to hear the news."She added: "Michael left to go back and live in the UK about a month ago and I understand he wanted to find representation in London. I have not been in contact with Michael for over a week."Today's arrests follow a long battle waged by Mr Lubbock's father, Terry, and his solicitor Tony Bennett. In addition to their campaigning in the media, they have submitted around 38 separate complaints to the Independent Police Complaints Commission alleging that the police handling of the case has been incompetent.Mr Bennett said the development vindicates their refusal to accept the offical explanation for Mr Lubbock's death.He said: "Today's move by the police is the best news possible for us. The only thing better would be the day that Mr Lubbock sees someone brought to justice for the murder of his son.""I started with a private prosecution of Michael Barrymore which related to alleged drug offences that night and didn't get anywhere but there was a lot of media interest and it forced Essex police to carry out a review, which lasted seven to eight months and then a reinvestigation which began in November."Mr Bennett said they had been compelled to keep going."Terry suffers every day from the fact that without knowing what happened and without justice, he has not been able to achieve closure," he said."That is the one thing that dominates his life. He has never said that Michael Barrymore was the perpetrator but he has always maintained that Michael Barrymore knows what happened."Mr Barrymore has previously stated that he did not know how Mr Lubbock died and suggested that injuries to the victim's body were inflicted away from the entertainer's home.Essex police remained tight-lipped about the evidence that led them to rearrest Mr Barrymore but sources close to the inquiry said they have been seeking to retrace their steps, looking for clues that may earlier have been missed and trying to reexamine items using the most up-to-date technology.It is understood that there has been a reanalysis of the emergency call that was made on the night Mr Lubbock's body was discovered with the hope that the background noise may yield some clues about what transpired.Advances in DNA analysis have also enabled officers to take a fresh look at items seized from Mr Barrymore's home at the time of the discovery. Witness statements have also been reconsidered using the latest computer technology.Essex police said in a statement today: "Police investigating the death of Stuart Lubbock who was found unconscious at an address in Roydon on March 31 2001 have today arrested three men on suspicion of murder and serious sexual assault."As it is police policy not to release any information that might reveal the identity of any arrested person, we will not be stating where the men are from."The family of Stuart Lubbock have been informed of the arrests and will be provided with any family liaison support that is required, as has been the case since Stuart died in 2001. As proceedings are now active we will not be making any further statements until there is any change to the current status."
