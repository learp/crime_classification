David Scott, who resigned as London's chief probation officer after the murder of two French students, said his service was "partly to blame" but that others, including ministers, also needed to learn lessons from the conviction of Daniel Sonnex, who was out on parole at the time of the killings.Scott said he was "filled with utter regret" that the murders took place on his watch as head of London Probation."I took full responsibility for the performance of the staff that I led, and tendered my resignation as soon as it was clear that failings in the probation service were partly to blame for allowing the crimes to take place."Scott was suspended in February and told he would face a "performance capability review". Scott, a former chief probation officer for West Sussex and the newly appointed chair of the Probation Chiefs Association decided to resign instead.In his first public statement since his resignation, Scott said today that the Sonnex case showed the probation service could not always guarantee success in managing offenders on release from prison."In this instance it was not solely the probation service that was at fault. I am concerned that efforts at personalising where fault lay will obscure the fact that there are unique challenges to delivering a high-quality probation service in London," he said.He argued that the sheer volume and complexity of cases and the scale of the operation required in London made it unlike any other British or European city."Many more dangerous criminals are released on to the streets of the capital than anywhere else in the country and there are recurrent problems in providing, supporting and equipping a sufficient number of skilled and experienced staff to monitor them," he said.He warned there were no "quick-fix" solutions to the underlying problems highlighted by this case. London probation staff had been devastated about what happened and were determined to improve the quality of the service, he said."For real and sustained change to happen, however, these lessons must be learned at every level, including government," said Scott, adding that probation was dependent on the quality and deployment of its staff."Probation risks becoming a Cinderella service unless urgent attention is paid to its workload, over which it has few effective controls, as well as to its absence from key decision-making about policy and resources."
