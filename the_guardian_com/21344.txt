A schoolboy who stored a gun, silencers and ammunition at home was sentenced to an 18-month detention and training order today.The child – who was 13 at the time, and one of the youngest convicted in Britain of firearms possession – had agreed to look after them for a fellow gang member.Police, who raided his Victorian terraced home in New Cross, south-east London, found a 31-round Russian-made Baikal IZH-79 semi-automatic pistol – regarded by police as gangland's gun of choice – in a basement cupboard.The weapon, with two silencers, had been wrapped in bags and a pillowcase and stuffed into a rucksack. Officers, who launched the raid after a tip-off, also found 31 rounds of 9mm ammunition stored in a sock. A barrel brush for cleaning another type of a gun was discovered in the loft.As the search continued with the help of a specially trained dog, a machete was recovered from the wardrobe in the youngster's bedroom.Although tests showed the gun in question was "clean" and not connected to any known crime, semi-automatics like this – unknown in this country until three years ago – have been involved in several murders.The youngster, who is now 14 and cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted to various possession charges.The Metropolitan police said he was the youngest child to be arrested by its central taskforce for having a gun.
