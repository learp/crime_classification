British friends of murdered student Meredith Kercher are to be called back to Italy by a Perugia judge to repeat off-hand remarks made to them by American suspect Amanda Knox. These could place Knox at the murder scene, sources said yesterday.The interviews were being scheduled as forensic tests last week identified Knox's DNA mixed with Kercher's in two bloodstains found in the Perugia house they shared. Kercher's body was found there on 2 November.Police see the results as crucial to proving the presence at the crime scene of Knox, 20, who is being held on suspicion of murder and sexual assault alongside her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 23, and Ivory Coast national Rudy Guede, 20. All deny involvement.Now investigators want to hear again the surprisingly detailed description of the murder Knox gave on 2 November to Kercher's friends. They told police that Knox claimed Kercher's body was lying next to the wardrobe in her bedroom, that she had suffered a single knife wound to the neck, and that her death was drawn out. 'How did Knox know this two days before the police?' said one investigator.The six British students who could be recalled before a judge include the three friends with whom Kercher dined on 1 November, before walking back to her house soon after 9pm.
