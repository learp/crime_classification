An estimated 500 Belfast mourners today defied loyalist paramilitary threats to attend the funeral of a man murdered by the Ulster Volunteer Force.They walked behind the funeral procession as it passed the spot on Shankill Road where Bobby Moffett was gunned down seven days ago. It has since become a shrine laden with flowers, soccer scarves, loyalist flags and written messages of defiance against the UVF.The 43-year-old loyalist was blasted in the face with a shotgun at lunchtime last Friday after a personal dispute with leading UVF figures.Moffett, a member of the UVF-aligned Red Hand Commando, was killed on the orders of a local loyalist leader who blamed him for torching a car belonging to him and attacking members of his family - an allegation Moffett's family deny.A senior police commander today described the murder as "a public execution linked to the Shankill UVF"."It is the police view that Bobby Moffett was lured to his death on the Shankill last Friday as part of a dispute involving individuals linked to the UVF," said Detective Chief Inspector John McVea of the Police Service of Northern Ireland's serious crime branch.The murder brings to 29 the number of people the UVF has killed since its 1994 ceasefire - all of its victims have been Protestants or loyalists who were deemed to have crossed the organisation. But as anger rose this week over the latest killing, the UVF sent text warnings that anyone attended protest vigils or the funeral would be forced out of the Shankill at gunpoint.A second, more ghoulish text was sent at the start of the week with an image of Moffett's blood splattered skull, was taken just minutes after he was shot.That move spectacularly backfired, however, in an area which the UVF has dominated for decades. The presence of so many people at today's funeral, alongside politicians from mainstream unionist parties, is a clear indication that the community is fed up with paramilitaries settling personal disputes through violence.The killing has also claimed a political casualty with the leader of the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party resigning. Dawn Purvis, the sole PUP representative on the Northern Ireland assembly, said she could "no longer defend the indefensible", and resigned her membership of the party; she will remain in post as an independent. Her resignation means that none of the loyalist paramilitaries are represented in the devolved parliament.So far only a handful of UVF members have been convicted in connection with its 29 post-ceasefire murders â€” the overwhelming majority emain unsolved.Victims' campaigners such as Raymond McCord, whose son Raymond Junior was beaten to death by a UVF gang in north Belfast in 1997, said the latest killing calls into question the validity of the organisation's ceasefire.Earlier this year the UVF claimed to have decommissioned all its weapons and wound down its "military" machine, but while it may have put semi-automatic weapons and its explosives beyond use, the group can still access weapons.The UVF gang thought to be responsible for the Moffett murder used two shotguns, weapons which cannot be forensically traced to any previous shooting.
