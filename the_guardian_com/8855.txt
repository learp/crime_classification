Commuters found themselves shut out of a busy London station after thieves boarded up the entrance and tried to steal a cash machine inside.Enfield Chase station in north London remained closed for much of Monday morning’s rush hour as British Transport police (BTP) investigated the incident.Gunter Hollenstein, who runs a cafe inside Enfield Chase, called police when he found the station blocked off.Hollenstein, 53, told the Evening Standard: “The entrance to the station was boarded up with plywood but there were no notices, which I thought was rather strange.“Then I got in touch with BTP and they knew nothing. “Some people arrived at the station. Because nobody knew what was going on, one bloke got so fed up he pushed his way through the boarded-up entrance and went up on to the platform.”Hollenstein went on: “He looked in the ticket hall and realised that they’d tried to take the cash machine out. They didn’t manage to open the safe, but the cash machine was completely destroyed. I reckon it was power tools they must have used.”A BTP spokesman said: “Our officers were called to Enfield Chase railway station around 5.30am after reports of a burglary of a cash machine.“Officers are at the scene and inquiries are ongoing. A side entrance to the station is now open.”
