One of Britain's most notorious gangsters used Facebook to threaten his enemies while serving a 35-year sentence in a maximum security prison, it emerged today.Colin Gunn, an underworld boss who helped plot the murder of two grandparents, sent messages to 565 "friends" after being transferred to a prison where he claimed officials had a relaxed attitude to social networking."I will be home one day and I can't wait to look into certain people's eyes and see the fear of me being there," Gunn wrote in one message, according to the Sunday Times.In another, he said: "It's good to have an outlet to let you know how I am, some of you will be in for a good slagging, some have let me down badly, and some will be named and shamed, fucking rats."Gunn, 42, was jailed in 2006 for the conspiracy to murder Joan and John Stirland, who were tracked down to the Lincolnshire seaside village of Trusthope, where they were killed in cold blood. Joan Stirland's son, Michael O'Brien, killed a friend of Gunn's.The Ministry of Justice said it was "extremely concerned" that Gunn had access to Facebook because prisoners were banned from accessing social networking sites. Prisoners are only meant to have access to the internet for educational purposes and under close monitoring.However, many are believed to be logging on through phone and other gadgets smuggled into prisons."We are extremely concerned that prisoners are able to update Facebook and other social networking sites either through illicit technology or via outside contacts," an MoJ spokesman said."The Public Order Act 1986 created offences dealing with causing harassment, alarm or distress. We will not hesitate to refer to the police any published material that appears to breach this."We recognise that it is deeply distressing for victims and their families and friends and we have made it clear to Facebook that we do not think it acceptable or appropriate for these sites to remain active, something Facebook agrees with."Gunn's Facebook site has now been shut down, a source told the Press Association.The latest internet breach comes after Jade Braithwaite, jailed for knifing to death Ben Kinsella, 16, used Facebook to taunt his victim's family.Earlier this month, relatives of victims of violent crime called for the introduction of electronic antisocial behaviour orders, or "E-Asbos" to stop convicted killers bragging online.Gunn was jailed with his brother David. The two considered themselves kings of the Bestwood estate in Nottingham, from which they ran their drugs and extortion rackets. They boasted they had made millions from drug deals and drove around in powerful cars, jewellery dripping from their necks and wrists.It is not the first time that the authorities have expressed fears that Gunn's criminal activities were continuing in prison. In 2007, the Nottinghamshire chief constable, speaking following the conviction of two corrupt officers who aided Gunn, suggested that the ganglord was communicating with associates.The justice secretary, Jack Straw, said: "I have sought the assistance of Facebook to have these profiles removed and we will continue to press for removal of these whenever we find them or whenever they are drawn to our attention."I am also hoping to meet with Ofcom, Facebook, victims' representatives and other government departments with an interest in this area to identify a solution to what is an issue of considerable concern to myself, victims and their families, and many members of the public."We will not hesitate to refer to the police any published material that appears to breach the law."
