The mother of two lived alone at the house. The 39-year-old's father is the multi-millionaire Malcolm Healey, who made much of his estimated Â£750m fortune when he sold his Hygena kitchen business.A Humberside police spokesman said Holtby, who was arrested in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, earlier this week, had been detained at Bridlington police station overnight and will appear at Beverley magistrates court today.Police refused to reveal the findings of a post-mortem examination on Ms Healey for "operational reasons".Her father, who keeps a low profile and spends much of his time in the US, owns a large estate around 10 miles from Ellerker.Yesterday, Ms Healey's family issued a statement in which they spoke of their shock at her death and asked for privacy. She was an animal lover who kept a large number of animals at her home, taking many of them in after they had been rescued by the RSPCA.
