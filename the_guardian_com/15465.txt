One of three people jailed over the death of Baby Peter has been scalded in an attack in prison.Steven Barker, the boyfriend of the abused infant's mother, was reported to have suffering scalding to his face and arm after another prisoner threw boiling water over him.The Sun newspaper reported that Barker, who is serving a life sentence at high security Wakefield prison, West Yorkshire, was scarred with a mixture of boiling water and sugar, known in prison circles as "napalm". The liquid sticks to the skin and intensifies burns.But a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, who confirmed a prisoner was treated for wounds, said sugar was not used in the attack.Islamic terrorist Dhiren Barot, who plotted to detonate a series of dirty bombs in the UK, was moved from Frankland prison, Durham, when he was badly scaled by another prisoner in 2007.A source told the Sun: "To say Barker is disliked is an understatement â€“ he is reviled. The other inmates all hate him with a passion."When Barker came here everyone knew what he had done to Baby P. Your card is marked if you have a crime against your name concerning kids."After the attack everyone was in good spirits, knowing someone had hurt Barker. The guy who did it will be getting applauded everywhere he goes now."A Prison Service spokesman said: "A prisoner at HMP Wakefield was assaulted by another. Staff intervened quickly and the prisoner received treatment. Police have been informed."Barker was jailed at the Old Bailey in May last year for contributing to the 50 injuries Peter suffered in his short life.The boy had been horrifically abused in the house his mother Tracey Connelly shared with Barker in Tottenham, north London.Connelly is serving a minimum of five years for causing or allowing Peter's death. Barker's brother Jason Owen, who was a lodger in the council house, was also jailed.Last month Barker lost his appeal against a further conviction for raping a girl of two.
