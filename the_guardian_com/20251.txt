A friend of a teenager who was murdered outside a takeaway told yesterday how he tried to help the 16-year-old moments after he was stabbed in the neck.Andrew Holland, who had hoped to pursue a career in the army, died after he became involved in a fight in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, along with a friend, named locally as Curtis McAtee, who suffered serious knife injuries.Wesley Greenhalgh, 15, who was at school with Andrew, said he saw the boys seconds after the attack late on Friday night. "I ran up to him and he was on the floor. He was gasping for breath, but he couldn't breathe," he said."I kept saying to him: 'Are you alright Andy?' but he didn't answer. He was really pale and white."Detective Superintendent Ian Foster said: "We believe there was a group, somewhere between three and five local youths, aged between 16 and 17, and an individual who was visiting the takeaway. There was some sort of verbal altercation which escalated into some physical assault."Mahmud Makxoudin, 21, of Madams Wood Road, Little Hulton, Manchester, was last night charged with murder and assault. He will appear at Bolton magistrates court this morning, police said.Andrew lived with his mother Joan, 44, and brother Aaron at a terrace home in Farnworth. His uncle, Mark, said in a statement: "We're completely devastated ... Andy was a bit of a cheeky monkey, but he was a good kid at heart."
