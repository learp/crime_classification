Shakilus Townsend was beaten and stabbed to death by members of the notorious Shine My Nine (SMN) gang, whose members identify themselves by orange bandanas or clothing. Samantha Joseph, the girl who lured Shakilus to his death, wore an orange T-shirt to the first day of her murder trial.Police believe the SMN gang has been active for more than a decade and has been built up by its original older members. It is one of a number of London-based groups that exist in a parallel culture in which stepping on to the wrong turf can result in a beating or worse.Detectives think the prime motivation for Shakilus's death was his rivalry with one gang member, Danny McLean, over Joseph. Another of his attackers had his own reasons for taking part: he had previously had his teeth knocked out by Shakilus when he challenged him for straying into the SMN area.Detective Inspector Barney Ratcliffe said: "These gangs are becoming more and more territory-conscious and picking on outsiders to those areas." He urged parents to take more responsibility for what their children were doing."We have got to be a lot more mindful about what our children are doing out on the streets on a day-to-day basis and we have got to be a little more intrusive as to who their friends are and what they are doing with those friends," Ratcliffe said. "We all have a responsibility, whether we are police officers, parents or local residents, to try and divert those youths from this gang and knife culture that seems to be plaguing our streets."He cited the example of Andre Johnson-Haynes, one of the youths involved in Shakilus's death, who was "insistent that he never wanted to be part of this gang culture" and attended the Â£14,000-a-year Emmanuel School in Clapham, south London, but became involved due to his friendship with McLean.
