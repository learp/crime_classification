The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided not to bring charges against four men who were arrested last year on suspicion of murdering Claudia Lawrence, a chef who disappeared after leaving her home in 2009.The CPS decision was confirmed by North Yorkshire police. The force issued a strongly worded statement saying that efforts to solve the case had been frustrated by “the reluctance of some, and refusal of others” to cooperate with police inquiries.Lawrence disappeared on her way to work in York in March 2009 and no sign of her has been found since. The four men, in their 50s and from the York area, were arrested last year as result of a review by the police that was initiated in 2013 after the formation of a new major crime unit.After it emerged on Tuesday that the CPS had decided not to bring charges against the four, North Yorkshire police said a lack of data, CCTV and other evidence from the time had frustrated the efforts of the review team.Claudia Lawrence: new fingerprints found five years after chef went missing However, the veteran detective who led the review also said he was now sure that there are a number of people who know what happened to Lawrence but who have refused to come forward or have been “economic with the truth”.Det Supt Dai Malyn said: “I am sure that there are some people who know, or who have very strong suspicions about, what happened to Claudia. “I am left with the inescapable conclusion that this case could still be solved if only people were honest with us. The fact that they are not is agonising for Claudia’s family and they should be ashamed of themselves.”Malyn said that a man pictured by a CCTV camera in Lime Court, Heworth Road, walking near to Lawrence’s house at the time of her disappearance “remains the most important person to trace”.The review has managed to unearth additional CCTV footage from that same camera shot the previous evening which appears to show the same man in the same place, according to police. This footage has been examined by experts in the UK and abroad, but the force has not been able to identify the man.Malyn added: “The lack of extended CCTV footage from that camera on the days and weeks either side of Claudia’s disappearance has been one of our biggest frustrations and is typical of the type of challenge that faces a cold case review team.”Investigators do not know if the man was in the area as a matter of daily routine, or whether his appearance is of critical significance. Malyn said: “I believe he must be local to the area, and despite extensive appeals, he hasn’t come forward. I can only speculate why he hasn’t done so, and whether someone is protecting him.”Lawrence lived in the Heworth area of York and was 35 when she disappeared. She was reported missing by her father, Peter, after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at a University of York kitchen.Police said they believe she was murdered, although no body has ever been discovered. Last year, the force released previously unseen CCTV footage of two people walking near her home on the evening she disappeared six years ago.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest
