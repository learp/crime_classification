Britain's only prison ship, brought into use seven years ago as a "temporary overcrowding measure," is entirely unsuitable as a 21st century prison and should be closed urgently, the chief inspector of prisons says in a report published today.Anne Owers says HMP Weare, which is moored at Portland, Dorset, is "literally and metaphorically a container", and although notionally a training prison it has no space for workshops, and not enough for exercise or education. The chief inspector says that significant money needs to be spent just to keep it seaworthy. She says that the prison ship, used as a troop ship in the Falklands war, and then a floating prison in America, was a temporary solution to what was envisaged as a temporary problem.
