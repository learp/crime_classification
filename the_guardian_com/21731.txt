One of the men accused of plotting to rob and murder the soul singer Joss Stone has previous convictions for assault and having knives or blades in public places, a jury has been told.The second man was admitted to a mental health unit in the pair's home town of Manchester after he was found sleeping rough in London, the court heard.Kevin Liverpool, 35, and Junior Bradshaw, 32, are accused of conspiring to rob and murder the 25-year-old singer. The men deny both charges and a third allegation of conspiring to cause her grievous bodily harm.They were found in a car near the singer's home in Devon in June 2011 with an "arsenal" of weapons including a samurai sword, knife, metal spike and hammers. Also discovered in their battered Fiat Punto car were balaclavas, gaffer tape and bin bags, Exeter crown court has heard.Notes found by the police allegedly suggest the two, who lived together in Manchester, had planned to decapitate Stone – whom they called a "she-devil" – and throw her body in a river.The prosecution has said their motive could have been financial but another note hinted they might have had a grudge against Stone because she had sung for the royal family and had been invited to Prince William's wedding.As the prosecution case concluded, details of the men's past were revealed to the jury. Liverpool has previous convictions for assault and for having bladed articles or knives in public places. On one occasion in 2007, a knife in a holdall along with a ski mask and gloves were found when he was stopped and searched. He was given a community sentence in 2010 with a mental health requirement.Bradshaw has been jailed 11 times for breaching a signing-on order telling police where he lived after he was convicted of exposing himself on the steps of Leeds town hall in 2006. Later he appeared at the Old Bailey after being found sleeping rough in London and was given a hospital order that led to him being admitted to a mental health unit in Manchester.Detective Sergeant Martin Sutcliffe told the court that Bradshaw's fingerprints had not been found on any of the weapons. Nor could any text messages or notes relating to the plot be attributed to him directly.Liverpool's fingerprints were found on some of the exhibits. Previously it has been alleged that he did research on Stone on a library computer.The men's defence is due to begin on Monday.
