Motoring organisations have accused the government of letting down car owners after a series of errors left a national crackdown on "cowboy clampers" in disarray.Laws were due to come into force today outlawing unlicensed firms which clamp unsuspecting motorists and extract up to Â£400 in return for the release of their cars. The Home Office minister Hazel Blears has ordered a last-minute postponement after discovering that only 20 of 600 firms which applied for clamping licences have had their applications dealt with correctly. Problems have been blamed on the exam board Edexcel, which is responsible for organising compulsory four-day training courses for clampers which include "charm" tips on dealing with irate motorists. Edexcel, which has previously been at the centre of controversy over A-level exams, struggled to mark clampers' papers and issue certificates on time. Bert Morris, director of the AA Motoring Trust, said: "Delaying the licensing regime amounts to giving a licence to dishonest, criminal operators to carry on." The Security Industry Authority said it hoped to resolve the problems by June.
