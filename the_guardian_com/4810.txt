There will be a knives amnesty for five weeks this summer, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, announced yesterday.He said it would allow members of the public to get rid of knives without fear of prosecution. It will run from May 24 to June 30 and involve police forces throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Mr Clarke said: "Tackling knife culture, especially among young people, is paramount to the safety of our communities, and I am determined to reduce the devastation caused by knife crime. Every weapon handed in during the amnesty will be a weapon that cannot be used in crime."
