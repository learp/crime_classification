An intruder armed with a knife was arrested last night in a secure area at the rear of Downing Street, Scotland Yard said today.The man is believed to have scaled an outer perimeter fence on Horseguards Parade and been challenged by an armed officer patrolling an area, known as the L-shaped street, behind the prime minister's residence.A Scotland Yard spokesman said the man had been arrested at 10.35pm yesterday on suspicion of affray after a scuffle with the officer and taken to a central London police station. On being searched, he was found to be in possession of a knife, thought to be of the kitchen variety."At this stage, we believe he scaled a fence on Horseguards Parade and was challenged by police on the other side," the spokesman said. "The incident is being handled by Westminster police and is not thought to be related to any terrorist act. We are satisfied that at no time was the prime minister at risk."Having scaled the outer fence, the man would still have had to navigate an inner security cordon to get close to Tony Blair, who was in Downing Street at the time, police said.No details of the man have been released, and police said they as yet had no idea what the intruder's motive might have been.Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism unit has been informed, but it is not handling the investigation into the incident. After examining the man, a doctor will decide whether he is fit to be interviewed.
