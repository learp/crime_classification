Police investigating the murder and abduction of the Glasgow teenager Kriss Donald yesterday arrested a man in connection with his death.Kriss, 15, was bundled into a car by a gang in the south side of Glasgow on March 15. His battered body was discovered by an early-morning jogger in a lane behind a Celtic supporters' club in the east end of the city the following day.At the time, police said he had been the victim of a "brutal and senseless attack". A spokesman for Strathclyde police said yesterday: "A 20-year-old man has been arrested and is presently detained in police custody in connection with the death." The 20-year-old man is expected to appear at Glasgow sheriff court on Monday. It is understood another man was also being questioned by police yesterday. Police said a number of Asian men were thought to be involved in his abduction. The white youth was taken from a street in the suburb of Pollokshields in broad daylight. The area is home to Scotland's largest Asian community, and the teenager's death heightened racial tensions. The British National party leader, Nick Griffin, was accused by community leaders of attempting to stir up trouble when he visited Glasgow a week after Kriss's death.
