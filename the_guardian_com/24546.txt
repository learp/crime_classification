Two teenagers died when their stolen car, which had been driven at speeds of up to 100mph, crashed into a police road block, an inquest heard yesterday.Scott Veach and Darren Franey, both 14, were killed instantly last March at the exit of the Kingsway tunnel in Liverpool, which runs beneath the river Mersey. Their stolen Vauxhall Vectra had smashed into the back of a Mercedes lorry which was being used as a roadblock by police. They were following another stolen car, driven by their friend Paul Maguire, 20, from Liverpool. He escaped with minor injuries after his car manoeuvred through a small gap in the road block. He is now serving five-and-a-half years detention for theft and motoring offences, but gave evidence at the hearing. Mr Maguire told Liverpool coroners' court he blamed the police. He said he and the two boys had stolen two cars from Chester and were being pursued at speeds of up to 120mph. The boys' parents wept as they watched a computer animated reconstruction showing the car race in the tunnel. Five tunnel police officers were suspended from duty following an investigation but the crown prosecution service has said that no one should face criminal charges over the deaths. The inquest hearing, which is scheduled to last at least three weeks, continues.
