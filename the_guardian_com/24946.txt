Trevor Baines, one of Britain's richest financiers, has been charged with money-laundering offences. Baines, 67, who has a fortune estimated at more than £160m, appeared in court late last year and stumped up £750,000 bail, with his mansion home in Douglas, Isle of Man, put up as security. Baines' advocate, Louise Byrne, said all charges will be 'vigorously defended at every level'.He is charged with suspected money laundering, involving Roys Poyiadjis, the former head of giant US software company AremisSoft. Allegedly, $195m of the company's money was moved between three accounts on the Isle of Man in 2001.Two years ago, Poyiadjis agreed to pay $200m to settle charges that he defrauded investors by making false statements about the software company's finances. Without admitting or denying the charges, he agreed to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission fraud case brought in October 2001. The SEC called the deal 'among the largest recoveries the SEC has obtained from an individual'.Based on the Isle of Man, Baines made his millions running the family business, Africa House Group, an offshore finance house. He invested in telecoms in the Nineties, selling out at the top of the market. Baines was also a successful driver, part of the Manx Cats team, and won the Jaguar Mark 1 Saloon Championship in 1998. The International Monetary Fund is poised this year to investigate tax havens suspected of harbouring money launderers. It is intent on checking on the number of compliance staff and investigators in these places. It is understood that the IMF's tough new stance has alarmed UK crown dependencies. In July 2001, AremisSoft sued short-sellers and TheStreet.com, claiming that they were conspiring to drive down the company's stock price by distributing false and misleading information. However, the company dropped that suit a month later after revealing that it was under investigation over some of the same issues.
