RIP Adrian pic.twitter.com/kskQWc2gBMApril 12, 2016Local media reported the armed robbery took place in Mt D’Or in the north of the island, as St John stopped his car to pick up the daughter of a female passenger. Police told the Trinidad & Tobago Guardian that two men robbed the passengers and then ordered St John to drive off but fired a gun after the car, hitting the British man. He died in hospital of his injuries, the paper said. St John’s cousin, Leandra Alexander, told the T&T Guardian he had been visiting the country for the carnival and was scheduled to return to the UK next Tuesday.“Adrian was very cool and jolly. He was a darling. He was never rude, never disrespectful, he was just a cool and quiet child,” Alexander said. Donovan Miller, a coach and mentor to St John at the Chris Gayle Academy, told the Press Association he was in shock. “I’m really finding it hard to come to terms with it, how someone could do something like that to such a lovely person,” he said.“He wanted me to support him to go to the Caribbean and to push hard with his cricket. He’s just finished his degree at university, which we supported him through as well.”Miller said one of the academy members broke the news to him in a phone call on Monday. He said Gayle was one of the first people he rang and said the cricket star knew St John “quite well”.Friends posted pictures on social media of St John in his cricket whites, with one calling him “one of the funniest and nicest people”.Tommy Smith (@tommysmith4)In utter shock to hear that one of my good friends Adrian has passed away.
