Your article on the tragic murder of Christopher Alaneme in Sheerness, Kent (He started singing 50 Cent ... then he said he was going, April 29) highlighted some challenging issues, particularly about the racism Christopher's friends said he and others experienced locally.This is a clear reason for Kent Police investigating whether there is evidence that his murder was racially motivated.I was, however, concerned that some local people who were interviewed suggested that I had visited the scene purely because the victim was black - and that I would not have gone there had he been white. This suggestion is inaccurate and untrue. Furthermore, as the article pointed out, a second stabbing victim, who survived, was white.Since taking up my post I have visited other scenes of serious crime where victims have been white. This year, for example, I visited Faversham following the murder of an elderly white couple. This crime attracted much fear and concern in the community, particularly among elderly residents.I went to Sheerness to be briefed on progress by the investigation team and, most importantly, to reassure local people.It is incorrect to suggest this was the first time that I had visited the Isle of Sheppey: I was there the week before this visit and have made at least four visits since coming to Kent two years ago, one shortly after I arrived.As you reported, the murder of Christopher Alaneme has shocked and frightened many within the community, from all ages and backgrounds.I was able to assure the people who I spoke to that Kent Police is committed to bringing those responsible for the killing to justice and to tackling violent and hate crime in all their forms.
