The speech from Jacqui Smith, Britain's first ever woman home secretary, marked a return to the "zero tolerance" law and order rhetoric of Labour's fist term.But she was also careful to extend the definition of zero tolerance to include treatment and prevention programmes as well as crime and disorder crackdowns.She had new money to announce for the police - a Â£50m pot - to fund the 10,000 new BlackBerries and mobile fingerprinting devices beat officers are to get to enable them to spend less time tied up in paperwork back at the police station.Indeed, her speech contained a major operation to underpin Labour's drive to roll out its promised neighbourhood policing teams in every area by next April."Pooled budgets" between local government and police in every neighbourhood are to be introduced alongside local crime figures so residents can get a clearer picture of what is happening in their neighbourhood than provided by the misleading "crime soaring out of control" headlines of the national media.Ms Smith, a 70s teenager, also proved herself Britain's first punk home secretary, comfortably quoting Sex Pistols tracks - not so much Anarchy in the UK, more Pretty Vacant - to put David Cameron's claim about the state of the country in its place.But she combined it with a Mary Whitehouse style-swipe at TV programmes that celebrate drunken behaviour on the screen.Later her aides named Ibiza Uncovered, which highlights the behaviour of holiday reps abroad, as a prime culprit.Jack Straw confirmed his plan to review the law on self-defence and for a new British bill of rights but surprised the audience with an announcement that as lord chancellor he is to abandon his wig on ceremonial occasions although the breeches and tights are to stay. As he told the "comrades" it was "a key step forward in the onward march to socialism".
