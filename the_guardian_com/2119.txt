Police have recovered a severed head from a canal where the decapitated remains of a former EastEnders actor were found.Scotland Yard said the discovery was made by a member of the public in Regent's Canal in Hackney, east London, on Sunday afternoon.The headless and limbless body of Gemma McCluskie, 29, was discovered in the same stretch of water six months ago.McCluskie, who played Kerry Skinner in the BBC TV soap in 2001, had been missing for a week after attending the Â£650m opening of the new Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London.She was last seen returning to the house in Pelter Street, Hackney, she shared with her brother, Tony McCluskie.A police spokesman said on Monday: "We can confirm that a head was recovered from Regent's Canal yesterday afternoon. It is still yet to be identified."The spokesman would not speculate on a connection with the killing of McCluskie, whose remains were found in March.Friends launched extensive searches across east London in a bid to find her, and her former EastEnders co-stars Natalie Cassidy and Brooke Kinsella both appealed for help on Twitter.McCluskie, 35, is due to stand trial accused of the murder of his sister on 12 November.
