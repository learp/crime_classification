A horse trader who fled from court while awaiting sentencing for the "worst case of animal cruelty the RSPCA has ever seen" was arrested today.Thames Valley police said James Gray, 46, was stopped by police in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, this morning. He will appear in Aylesbury crown court, Buckinghamshire, for sentencing tomorrow.Gray was convicted, with his wife and three of his children, after the neglect at Spindle Farm in Amersham, Buckinghamshire.They had appealed against their convictions and sentencing, which meant Gray's 24-week prison sentence had been on hold. He was unsuccessful in his appeal and was sentenced to 26 weeks in jail in his absence during the hearing, on 12 May.It is thought Gray had simply walked out past security guards and into Aylesbury town centre.At the time, Judge Christopher Tyrer said: "What the court has been listening to is an horrendous case of animal cruelty. It is the worst case ever experienced by the RSPCA."RSPCA officers had found horses crammed into pens ankle-deep in their own faeces, with carcasses littered across the fields. In all, 114 horses were removed from the site, many in a state of starvation; three had to be put down. In all, 32 horses were found dead at the farm.Gray and his teenage son, James Gray Jr, were found guilty of 11 charges each under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, after a trial last year. Two of the charges were dropped when they launched an appeal after sentencing last June.Gray's wife, Julie, 42, and daughters Jodie, 27, and Cordelia, 21, had each been found guilty of two animal welfare offences. The women were each given a 150-hour community service order.Gray was banned from keeping horses, ponies and donkeys for life; his wife, son and daughters were banned from doing so for 10 years.The investigation cost the RSPCA more than £1.4m including court costs and veterinary bills. Gray was ordered to pay the charity £400,000.
