Hundreds of indecent images of pupils have been found on the computer of the deputy head of an Essex school who was recently found dead, police say.Essex police discovered nearly 600 indecent images of boys taken secretly in the swimming pool and changing rooms by Martin Goldberg, 46, a maths teacher at Thorpe Hall school in Southend.The photographs of boys aged nine to 12 appeared to have been taken on a camera hidden in a bag, police said, from 2000 onwards.A spokeswoman for the force said there was no evidence that Goldberg made inappropriate physical contact with any child. The spokeswoman added: “The school has cooperated with our investigation and we have also found no evidence to suggest that anyone else was involved in Mr Goldberg’s criminal activity. There is also no information that he shared any of these images or that anyone else was aware of his offending.“Essex police understands that this news may be extremely distressing to both parents and children and has set up a special number for people to call if they have any concerns or believe they have information that would assist the investigation.”Goldberg was found dead at his home in Shoeburyness, south-east Essex, with serious wounds two weeks ago – a day after he was contacted by police officers as part of their investigation.Police said 465 indecent images were taken on Goldberg’s hidden camera in the swimming pool and 75 in Thorpe Hall school’s male changing rooms. A further 38 images were taken in two other locations.Four children have been identified from the pictures and their parents informed, police said, but in the vast majority of images the boys’ faces are obscured because the pictures are low quality.Police said the school, an independent day school that charges up to £3,540 a term, had put in place special measures to support its pupils.The discovery came after detectives launched an investigation on 9 September into allegations that Goldberg had purchased images of naked teenage boys over the internet.Officers spoke to Goldberg on the same day at his home as part of the investigation but he was not arrested due to insufficient evidence. However, when police returned the following day Goldberg was found dead with severe injuries. His death is not being treated as suspicious, police said.Nick Alston, the police and crime commissioner for Essex, expressed grave concerns over the discovery as it emerged that police had received intelligence about Goldberg nine months ago.Alston said police in Toronto had contacted Essex police last November with information that Goldberg had purchased videos of naked boys several years ago. However, the investigation was only launched on 9 September.“It is important that we understand why it took nine months for the force to act on this information. There may be valid reasons but we deserve an explanation,” said Alston.The force has referred its handling of the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which has the power to investigate police failures.Alston added: “It would be wrong of me to pre-empt the findings of that investigation, but my initial judgment is that it is likely that something has gone badly wrong here, including possibly in the original assessment and review by CEOP [the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre].“I have also asked Essex police urgently to review any information or intelligence they possess, such as the material from police in Toronto, about potential paedophile activity in our county and the processes for risk assessment reports of such activity. It is essential that our communities have confidence that Essex police is doing everything in its power to investigate intelligence or information about paedophiles in a rapid and thorough fashion.”Goldberg, who taught maths at the school for 23 years, was described as a “much loved teacher, colleague, deputy head and, for many of us, our friend” in tributes following his death.Thorpe Hall’s headteacher, Andrew Hampton, said at the time that Goldberg’s death was a massive shock and that the school was preparing an event to celebrate his life.In a statement on Tuesday, Hampton said staff were “surprised, angry and betrayed” but that the immediate focus was to support pupils and parents.“The school governors and staff are all very shocked by the news about Mr Goldberg,” Hampton said. “He was a well-regarded teacher who had an exemplary record during his 23 years at the school and there were no indications whatsoever that Mr Goldberg was leading a double life.”He added: “An incident such as this is very alarming and no one could have foreseen it. Our safeguarding policies were inspected in March by the Independent Schools Inspectorate and judged to be fully compliant within the ISI’s rigorous framework. There were no recommendations for areas to improve.“Despite this, we are reinforcing our safeguarding procedures to ensure our provision goes beyond the highest standards expected of all UK schools and are as watertight as it is possible to have them. We will also be providing additional staff training in safeguarding and will continue our close working relationship with the local authority.“Our aim now is to move forward, with the safeguarding of our pupils and the quality of their education remaining our very highest priority.”There is no suggestion that anyone else was involved in Goldberg’s criminal activity or that he shared the images, police said.
