The Home Office has achieved its self-imposed deadline of getting all 43 police forces in the UK to put up online crime maps. But are any of them any good?As reported by us last week (Police launch online neighbourhood crime maps, 6 January), the maps are intentionally limited. Simon Reed, the vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Our concern is that statistics released on a monthly basis may feed local criminal intelligence, leading to crime hotspots, and further exacerbate the public's fear of crime."The full list is on the Police Forces website.Richard Allan, the chair of the government's Power of Information taskforce, wrote on its blog that the maps should be seen as only a first step: "It should also be an objective of this process to create better availability and consistency of the underlying crime data sets so that other parties can innovate with their own versions of crime maps."Jo Wadsworth, news editor of the Croydon Advertiser, told the media website journalism.co.uk that the maps "don't give a particularly accurate reflection of true crime statistics in any one area. For instance, they don't include sexual assaults, which would certainly be one type of crime I would be very interested in learning what the rates are."Though the implementations are uneven in style, that will evolve, suggests Simon Dickson, a web developer for government departments. "Best practice will evolve, and we'll move steadily - maybe over two or three iterations - to a more consistent experience," he commented on the POI blog.Even so, a growing number of police forces in the US provide raw data about crimes that outside organisations can use to map crime locations. The Free Our Data campaign still maintains that doing so in the UK would be beneficial.â€¢ Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog.
