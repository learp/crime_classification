Police have asked volunteer search parties helping hunt for missing Sian O'Callaghan to stay away after narrowing down the area of forest they are combing.Hundreds of people had turned up in Savernake Forest, near Marlborough, in Wiltshire on Tuesday to help look for signs of O'Callaghan in the dense woodland.But detectives have asked people to stay away for the moment as they had used "technological techniques" to focus their attention on a particular part of the forest.Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher, who is leading the hunt, said: "The inquiry moves on at a rapid pace, with significant lines of inquiry being developed. The public have been fantastic in support of the search for Sian O'Callaghan and I'm very grateful."I've been able to use new technological techniques to provide a tighter search parameter and have been able to rule out large areas of the six-and-a-half-mile radius we have all been searching."Those tactics are being urgently progressed today by specialists. I may need further support from the public closer to the weekend but for now I would ask that people monitor the force website, media and social networks for my further requests if they are required."O'Callaghan, 22, disappeared after leaving Suju nightclub in Swindon at about 2.50am on Saturday to walk the half mile home to the flat she shares with her boyfriend, Kevin Reape.O'Callaghan's mobile phone records suggests that just over 30 minutes after she left the club her phone was somewhere in the 4,500-acre Savernake Forest. Police say the journey there could only have been made in a vehicle and they have been searching the forest since the weekend.Searchers were told to look for O'Callaghan or items she owned, including her LG E900 Optimus mobile phone.Detectives will not give details of the technology they have used to narrow the search down but it is possible that further analysis of her mobile phone records may have helped officers pinpoint more closely where her mobile ended up after she left the club.Coachloads of volunteers – including close friends of the office administrator – had been preparing to depart from Swindon and travel 12 miles to the woodland to search for her.A reward of £20,000 has been offered by an anonymous donor for information leading to O'Callaghan being found.Meanwhile a vigil and prayer service for her is being held on Wednesday at St Barnabas Church in Gorse Hill, Swindon.
