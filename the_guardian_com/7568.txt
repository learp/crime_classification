It is still not clear where she was heading to."Leah is described as 4ft 11ins tall with a petite build. She has a light complexion and long black hair. Leah was wearing a red top and blue jeans."I appeal to anyone who saw Leah in south-east London or on the 172 bus or its route on Saturday 12 September to contact us.""We also need to hear from anyone who may have seen her after September 12 and up until her body was found as we need to understand where she was going, who she was meeting and how she came to be murdered."
