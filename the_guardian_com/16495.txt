The government's majority was more than halved as its controversial plan to part-privatise the probation service scraped through the Commons.The home secretary, John Reid, offered a series of concessions and reassurances to critics of the offender management bill.But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said that they went no way to address the central "flaws" of the bill, which passed its third reading by 293 votes to 268 last night after 24 Labour rebels voted against it.Mr Reid bitterly accused the opposition of a "cheap opportunistic hit" by opposing the bill's third reading.Mr Davis said that the legislation was about "more centralised government control" and a "real distraction from the problems at hand". It would do nothing to tackle prison overcrowding or soaring reoffending rates.Earlier, 49 Labour rebels voted against the government and in favour of keeping key elements of probation work in the public sector.The rebel amendment was, however, comfortably defeated with a majority of 156 as the Tories abstained.The bill allows private companies and voluntary groups to take over some of the probation service's work by enabling ministers to commission services from the "best available provider".Mr Davis warned the Tories would seek to "massively" amend the legislation in the Lords.
