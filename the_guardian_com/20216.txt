A soldier accused of spying for Iran while serving in Afghanistan could have cost the lives of coalition troops, a trial at the Old Bailey heard today.Corporal Daniel James, 45, worked as an interpreter for General David Richards, the head of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and is alleged to have been passing coded messages to the Iranian military attache in Kabul after being called up as a Territorial Army reservist in 2006.The court heard he was found with a USB memory stick that contained two confidential documents with details about troop movements and munitions.Carl Buckland Jr, an American intelligence officer working for Nato, told the court that the documents contained details of "where soldiers were going to be at a tactical and also a strategic level" and information about senior level visits to Afghanistan."Compromise of such information to enemy combatants could adversely impact the effectiveness of operations and could have resulted in Nato casualties," Buckland told the court."This is some of the more sensitive data from our perspective which reflects what our soldiers are doing - where we are weak on the ground or strong on the ground."If the information was compromised, he said, the enemy "would know where to avoid our soldiers and where to attack."Earlier in the day the court also heard that James, an Iranian-born salsa dance instructor from Brighton, had acted strangely by taking photos of Tony Blair while he was on a visit to the country.Speaking via a video link from Afghanistan, Sergeant Gareth Podesta, a member of Richards' close protection team, told the court it was "strange" that James accompanied officers to meet Blair's visiting party when he landed at a Kabul base in 2006."He was out on the football pitch which is where the helicopters land, taking photos," Podesta said. "There was nobody else apart from the general and his close staff, and the protection team such as myself. It seemed strange why he was there.""He was in proximity, about 20 metres, walking along taking photos."Podesta then told the court that James "talked about the fact he didn't like Tony Blair"."He didn't like the taxes in the UK and thought it needed a new government."Through a statement, an Afghan translator known as N, who also worked with James, said he had expressed sympathy with Iran when they had watched television reports about its dispute with the US over uranium production."James said the US cannot fight the Iranians because Iran is a power in the region. He appeared to be supporting Iran," it said.The court also heard that James had been reprimanded for his lack of punctuality and a tendency to disappear. Members of Richards' staff would be concerned that the general would be kept waiting because James had gone to talk to people and couldn't be found.On one occasion he was told off by a sergeant for wandering off while Richards' convoy was parked at the Afghan president's palace, to which James told the sergeant to "fuck off you're a racist". Podesta said. The court heard the claim had been taken "very seriously" and investigated by a sergeant major.Podesta told the court that James was unhappy at being told off and appeared to think "he could do what he wanted".Another Afghan translator, known only as V, said in a statement that he was not sure what to believe when James talked about his life back in Britain. "He stated that he was a body-building champion of northern England. He also said he held salsa classes."He was very happy to talk about himself. I was not sure he was telling the truth. He showed me a movie recorded on a video camera which proved that he was a salsa trainer."Lieutenant colonel Felix Gedley, who worked as a military assistant to Richards, told the court James claimed to have been approached by American spies. "He mentioned fairly early on when we first met that he'd been approached by the CIA for training. At the time I put it down to big talk," Gedley said.James denies communicating and collecting information useful to an enemy, under the Official Secrets Act, and of willful misconduct in public office.
