The family of murdered schoolboy Joe Geeling said last night they could not adequately describe the heartache of their loss: 'None of you have enough time to hear how much he meant to us.'The body of 11-year-old Joe, from Bury, Greater Manchester, who disappeared on his way home from school, was formally identified yesterday after it was found dumped in a local park last Thursday.A Home Office pathologist has completed a postmortem examination of the body and reported that Joe died of multiple stab wounds.Last night a 14-year-old boy from Bury was charged with his murder.Joe's parents, Tom and Gwen, his sisters Kelly and Danielle and brothers Sean and James issued a joint statement saying he was a 'special person' who remained positive despite the fact that he suffered from cystic fibrosis.In a joint statement, they said: 'Everybody wants us to make a statement or give a few comments on how much Joe meant to us and what a loss he will be.'None of you have enough time to hear how much he meant to us. How do you condense 11 years of fun and love and heartache, worries and accomplishments into a few words?'Joe was one of those special people that if you ever met him and spent even five minutes talking to him he would leave an impression on you that you would remember, and usually with fondness.'The family described him as a normal little boy who loved football, computer games and Bart Simpson. Joe was a pupil at St Gabriel's Roman Catholic High School in Bury.The family added: 'We were spoilt, we had him every day. He had a few problems being a child born with cystic fibrosis, but all those who knew him know that he refused to be restricted by that.'He got on with life and made minimum fuss about his condition. You really needed to know him to appreciate his potential and now some of you will never know him. Joe had a huge circle of family and friends, all of whom are equally devastated.'Police said the 14-year-old boy would appear in Bury Magistrates' Court on Monday.Forensic officers have made a detailed examination of the spot where Joe's body was found, a wooded gully at the side of Whitehead Park, Ainsworth, Bury.A house near the park has also been searched by forensic teams for clues. A neighbour said it was occupied by a teenage boy and his mother.Special church services will be held in Bury today.
