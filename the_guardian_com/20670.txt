The mother of an 11-year-old boy who was critically ill in hospital yesterday with serious burns condemned the "sick people" thought to have set him on fire.West Mercia police are trying to find out how John Baldwin - who was found by passers-by on a canal towpath in Worcester on Wednesday - suffered 30% burns to his chest and abdomen.But his mother, Sandra, issued a statement condemning the apparent attack on her son, who is being treated at a specialist unit in south Wales.Mrs Baldwin said: "Who could throw something flammable on a young lad in the street, set him on fire and then leave him? "They must be sick. There is no other way to describe them than sick."In the statement issued by police, Mrs Baldwin added: "Johnny has lots of friends and is known by many people. We hope that someone will come forward who will know who he was with and can help to identify who could have done such a terrible thing to him."The boy was treated at the Worcestershire Royal hospital before being transferred to the paediatric burns ward at Morriston hospital, Swansea.John, who has two sisters aged 10 and nine, is a keen skate-boarder and mountain-biker and spent much of his spare time at or near Worcester's Perdiswell Skate Park.He was due to attend Elgar high school in September, transferring from Warndon junior school.Detective Sergeant Andy Price, of Worcester CID is leading the inquiry. He said: "We are keeping an open mind as to how John came by his injuries, but there is an indication that something such as an accelerant may have been thrown on him and then ignited."On the other hand, there is currently nothing to confirm that that is the case and there could have been a dreadful accident."At the moment, we are not able to talk to John about what really happened as he is sedated. It could be some time before we can speak with him."The detective continued: "We want to hear from anyone who was with John - or has been told who was with him. It is a smallish community in the area where we believe this happened and people talk to each other."
