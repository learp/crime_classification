A young woman has spoken of her “living hell” as her abusive ex-husband was jailed for life with a minimum of 28 years for shooting her mother as an act of revenge.Tariq Rana, 31, travelled from his home in Wolverhampton to Pakistan intent on tracking down relatives of his 28-year-old wife Ayesha Riaz, who split up with him a year after their arranged marriage.UK court convicts man of revenge killing in Pakistan He shot his mother-in-law, Ghulam Asia, at her house in Lahore with an unnamed accomplice, dressed as a delivery man.The pair rang the doorbell and when Asia, 49, went to the gate to sign for the delivery, Rana shot her twice at close range.Fifteen minutes later, he texted his sister in the UK, saying: “Yeah I shot the bitch fully I think she expired.”He then made a series of angry and aggressive telephone calls to Riaz’s brothers, threatening to kill them all unless she came back to him.Earlier this week, Rana was convicted of murder at Woolwich crown court following a trial.On Friday, the victim’s family sat in the Old Bailey behind a screen obscured from the dock, as Riaz’s emotional victim impact statement was read out on her behalf.In it, she said: “Words cannot begin to describe the way it feels knowing my mother has been killed by my ex-husband. Not a day passes where I do not regret marrying him and becoming a victim of his physical abuse.”She said that the family lived in fear that he would attempt to kill us all to the point where they were even too scared to open the door.She told how her sisters in Pakistan had been devastated by the “ghastly crime” and the family home had been sold because they could not bear to stay.She said: “They watched their mother covered in blood and dying in front of their eyes on the doorstep of their home. It was not her time to go. This incident has become a nightmare.”They were left in a “living hell”, she added: “Just to satisfy his own dirty ego, Tariq Rana has killed the mother of six children. Now we will spend the rest of our lives feeling afraid and vulnerable.”Rana showed no reaction as Mr Justice Singh sentenced him to life for the killing which he said was borne out of Rana’s obsession with taking revenge on his wife’s family.The judge told him: “You married Ayesha Riaz in Lahore in 2011. She then came to live in this country with you.“However, the marriage was one in which you were abusive and this led to her leaving you in May 2012. You were upset and angry about that. You became obsessed and wished to take your revenge on Ayesha Riaz and members of her family. You made threatening calls in the middle of 2012, including calls to Ghulam Asia in Pakistan,” said the judge.The court heard that Rana had already served a 42-month sentence for making threats to kill after being convicted in 2014.Earlier in mitigation, Jeremy Dein QC told the court: “It is clear Mr Rana felt an overwhelming sense of grievance at the way in which the relationship had unfolded and it is clear that none of this would have happened had he not had this state of mind.“Tariq Rana committed this act in a background of emotional turmoil and an immovable sense he and the family had been badly treated.”Rana was prosecuted in the UK under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 for the attack on 27 July 2013.The statute gives authority for a UK national to stand trial for a murder committed overseas.Rana’s sister, Nargus Ahmed, 33, and brother-in-law, Muhammed Adeel, 35, were both acquitted of assisting an offender following the four-week trial.
