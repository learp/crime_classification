Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, yesterday warned that the overcrowded jail system in England and Wales was in a "serious crisis" which the home secretary could not simply build his way out of."I worry at the moment that as fast as quick-build units will be put up, they will be filled," she warned. "It is normally considered good practice to build an ark before a flood, not during or after it."Launching her annual report after meeting John Reid, Ms Owers said that she could not see any easy way out of the crisis in the immediate future. "I can't say other than we have a serious crisis and one which is impacting on the ability of prisons to do rehabilitation."It is also making them riskier places to run. It is an alarming and, potentially, very damaging situation."The prison population fell by a further 200 yesterday, providing more evidence that the appeal to the judges to find alternatives to prison for non-dangerous offenders may be arresting the rise in the jail population, which hit 80,000 last week.The chief inspector's report was published as sentencing statistics for 2005 were published showing that the total numbers imprisoned annually have risen from 79,500 in 1995 to 101,200 in 2005, with average crown court sentence lengths increasing by 25% to 25.9 months. The annual sentencing figures also show that the numbers imprisoned and average sentence lengths dipped between 2003 and 2005 but are believed to have since resumed their upward trajectory, triggering the current prison crisis. New Home Office figures also show that police numbers have fallen slightly for the first time in seven years, with 141,873 officers in post last September - a fall of 173 compared with the previous year.Ms Owers said yesterday that prison inspection reports published since last April showed a disturbing trend, with too many local prisons whose cultures and practices were now "slipping back or failing to improve" when it came to rehabilitation and resettlement work."These are only straws in the wind - but the wind does not appear to be blowing in the right direction. And it is unlikely to be more favourable next year," she says in the introduction to her annual report. "True, more prison places are being planned, but they are chasing ever-rising numbers. There is a real risk that already stretched resources within prisons will be spread even more thinly."The situation had been exacerbated by the failure of ministers to act on her previous warnings such as the 1,300 foreign national prisoners being held beyond the end of their sentences while they await deportation, and the position of vulnerable women and mentally ill prisoners who lacked secure provision outside prison.Ms Owers said she was particularly concerned about the impact of the far higher than expected number - 2,000 since April 2005 - of offenders who have been imprisoned under the new indeterminate public protection sentence without a fixed release date.A Prison Service spokeswoman said 8,000 more prison places were to be built.The Tory leader, David Cameron, said his party had been warning the government "for years" that it needed to build more prisons. But prisons minister Gerry Sutcliffe said: "I am heartened by the chief inspector's recognition that, despite continued population pressures, significant improvements continue to take place in many key areas of prison life."

It is normally considered to be good practice to build an ark before the flood rather than during or after it."On prison performance"We have seen too many local prisons recently whose cultures and practices are sliding back, or failing to improve."These are only straws in the wind - but the wind does not appear to be blowing in the right direction."Deaths in custody "The reduction in self-inflicted deaths is most evident in the early days of custody, assisted by better first night and detoxification. Yet a significant number of prisoners are now spending their first night, or nights, in police or even court cells, where there is none of this support."The 2,000 new public protection prisoners who have no release date "For the first time ever there were more prisoners serving indeterminate sentences [including lifers] than those who were serving short sentences of less than 12 months. These are unparalleled increases."Immigration detainees "There remain serious concerns, including the 2,000 children [detained] each year, usually for short periods but sometimes for weeks or months."
