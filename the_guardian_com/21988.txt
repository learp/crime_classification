A former commercial airline pilot has been jailed for life after being convicted of deliberately driving his car into a tree to murder his wife in an "act of pure evil".Iain Lawrence, 53, disabled the passenger airbag and moments before ploughing his car into the tree unclipped his wife Sally's seatbelt, because he could not cope with the break-up of their 12-year marriage.Speaking after the sentencing at Leicester crown court, Catherine Kudhail, Mrs Lawrence's sister, said: "Our family is here today because of the cruel, callous, evil and sickening act of murder against our beautiful Sally. On the day Sally died, a part of us died with her."High court judge Mr Justice Leggatt told Lawrence he would serve a minimum of 24 years in prison for the "brutal and carefully planned" murder.The sentence came after a jury of six men and six women took just over eight hours to convict him of murder by a majority of 11-1 following a three-week trial.During the trial, the jurors heard the couple's marriage had begun to break down in 2007 but Lawrence would not accept the split and remained at the couple's matrimonial home, which was in his wife's name, hoping for reconciliation.Mrs Lawrence instigated divorce proceedings in June last year and was by then seeing another man.In the months before her death, the 47-year-old, who had two children from a previous relationship and a son with Mr Lawrence, told friends she feared her "cold and calm" husband would try to kill her.The night before her death, the pair rowed over the details of the divorce settlement.On 6 October last year, just two days before the final part of the couple's divorce was due to be granted, Lawrence ploughed his car into a tree on Gartree Road in Oadby, Leicestershire at more than 50mph.Mrs Lawrence died of "catastrophic" injuries, while her husband was uninjured after adopting the brace position during the collision.Mr Justice Leggatt said: "It is clear to me from the evidence that you had two motives for murdering Sally. One was that you could not and would not accept that your marriage was over and were determined that Sally would never leave you."Your other motive was financial gain. You refused to accept that Sally should have the money from the house, although you had been advised that it was her due."Lawrence had denied murder and claimed he suffered a leg spasm in the moments before the crash that left him unable to touch the brakes.The jury heard Lawrence feigned unconsciousness in the driver's seat when passers-by stopped to help.Witnesses described Lawrence, who initially told police he had no memory of the crash, as squeezing his eyes shut "like a child" at the scene.The court heard details of the crash came back to him "in a nightmare" a month later.Mr Justice Leggatt said: "The evidence at this trial has clearly established how you killed Sally. As you approached the spot which was your target, you reached across and unclipped her seatbelt. Then you steered the car at the tree and drove straight into it at over 50mph."You had the protection of an airbag and seatbelt â€“ protection you had made sure that Sally did not have; and to protect yourself further you got into the brace position before the crash."It was not chance but the results of your careful and cold-blooded planning, that you came away from the collision with a few bruises, while Sally died of catastrophic injuries."You thought that the crash would be seen as a tragic accident and that you would get away with murder. You would indeed have done so it if had not been for the careful and thorough investigation carried out by the police."Family and friends of Mrs Lawrence clapped and shouted "yes" from the public gallery as the verdict was read out.Speaking after the sentencing today, Kudhail said: "Sally's murder was an act of pure evil. She was an inspirational, caring, kind young woman with a huge heart. She was so full of life."Losing her has been unbearable; not a day goes by without her being in our thoughts. She has been taken from us at the most happiest point in her life and has been denied what was undoubtedly to be a very happy future."We would like to extend our gratitude to the jury, who have seen through the lies and deceit of Iain Lawrence in his attempt to minimise his responsibility for the brutal murder of Sally."They have played a huge part in finally enabling this murderer to be held to account for taking our daughter, sister and friend from us and for taking a mother from her three children."Detective Superintendent Neil Castle, from Leicestershire Police, said: "Collectively we have proved that Iain Lawrence intentionally drove his car into a tree, after deactivating the passenger airbag and unclipping the passenger seatbelt."These actions resulted in the death of Sally Lawrence and he has now been convicted of her murder."This offence was premeditated and planned and was driven by jealousy and financial gain; these facts have influenced his substantial sentence."In cases like these there is always more than one victim. Sally leaves behind a grieving family including her two daughters, Jess and Rosie, and her son, William."The whole family have shown immense strength throughout the investigation and trial and I hope that today's verdict provides them with some comfort."
