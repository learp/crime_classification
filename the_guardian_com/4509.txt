Age: 47.Appearance: Slightly wilted.I know this is one of those schemes to make Britain nicer. But is it the one about stopping burglars, or the one about putting rubbish in bins? It's the one about planting flowers. The clue's sort of in the name. Every year, communities from Aberdeen to Frinton, from Belfast to Croydon, take part in a competition organised by the Royal Horticultural Society. No park is left without its beds of pansies, no roundabout without its floral clock.How quintessentially British, assuming "quintessentially" means what I think it does. I can just see those pretty little villages, like something out of Midsomer Murders. The inspiration was French, the sponsor used to be Shredded Wheat, and the categories include "large city" and "urban community". Other than that, your misty-eyed imaginings are spot on.Come again? Not for the first time, Britain in Bloom has fallen victim to foul play. The North Yorkshire village of Cayton has just witnessed the sort of crime that can only be solved by the likes of Inspector Barnaby.A murder in the potting shed? Much worse. A saboteur spread weedkiller around the village, causing Â£20,000 worth of damage. It may be impossible to repair it all before judging takes place.That's a lot of plants. Thirty sites were attacked, and 200 tonnes of soil will have to be changed.Are there any suspects? Fingers are being pointed at locals, rather than a rival village. "People have had little hassles with us in the past," says Les Hutchinson, chairman of Cayton in Bloom.And this sort of thing has happened before? The Teesside resort of Saltburn- by-the-Sea lost 400 hanging baskets and 150 tubs in 2003, again to weedkiller. Locals were blamed then too.Any leads this time? "Someone out there knows who is responsible," say North Yorkshire police. In other words, they don't.Do say: "We have to nip this in the bud."Don't say: "Hanging baskets are too good for them."
