The son of a 60-year-old man who was stabbed to death in a vicious and apparently motiveless attack on a cycle path has appealed for help in finding the killer.Aulton Thomas Rogers, who was known as Tom, was found dead on the path 100 metres from Swindon railway station. A bicycle was discovered nearby.Wiltshire police said Rogers, a pub worker, was the victim of an "extremely vicious attack" and urged people who live or work in the area to be vigilant.Rogers' son David, 35, paid tribute to a "sociable and well liked" man. He said: "He worked hard at the pub and I would often meet him there. It hasn't sunk in that my dad is gone and that I won't be able to spend time with him any more."I really feel his loss and will always miss my dad. I would like anybody who knows anything about what happened to my dad to please call the police."Rogers suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack. Police said he left the pub and headed home shortly before 10.30pm on Thursday night and was found shortly before midnight.Rogers lived alone in Walcott, Swindon. He was not known to the police and detectives have not found a motive for the attack.DCI Sean Memory said: "We continue to work tirelessly on the case to identify those responsible and would ask anyone who knew Mr Rogers to contact us. This will help us to build a bigger picture of his lifestyle."
