A woman who killed a grandmother in a row over a parking space was jailed for four years yesterday by appeal court judges.To the fury of the victim's family, Carol McMillan had initially been placed on probation for killing Ann Whittle in an unprovoked attack last August.But at the appeal court in Edinburgh yesterday Lord Cullen said the initial sentence was unduly lenient and imposed a term of imprisonment.Mrs Whittle died after McMillan pulled her to the ground and repeatedly kicked her in the face in a row over parking at a Glasgow car boot sale.
