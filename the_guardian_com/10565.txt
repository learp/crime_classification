The mother of Khyra Ishaq, the seven-year-old girl who died after she was allegedly starved at her Birmingham home, appeared before a court today charged with causing or allowing her daughter's death.Angela Gordon, 33, and her partner, Junaid Abuhamza, 29, appeared via videolink at Birmingham crown court, charged under the 2004 Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act.The couple, who lived together with Khyra and her siblings in Handsworth, Birmingham, spoke only to confirm that they understood the charges against them. They were not required to enter a plea at the hearing.The judge, Frank Chapman, told the pair: "This is just the beginning of the case against you. The prosecution have about eight weeks to assemble all the evidence they will rely on."The process would take slightly longer than usual because a number of experts would need to be consulted, the judge said.A plea and case management hearing has been scheduled for September 1.Gordon and Abuhamza were remanded in custody when they appeared before magistrates in Birmingham two days after Khyra's death on May 17. The Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board has launched a case review into the circumstances of her death.
