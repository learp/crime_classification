The double-killer Levi Bellfield is on trial for the murder of Milly Dowler because his subsequent convictions for murder gave police an "easy opportunity" to close the file on a crime that "shocked the nation", a jury has been told."But for his convictions, you may think, he wouldn't be here," said Jeffrey Samuels, QC for Bellfield, who claimed the prosecution had "marshalled and tailored" evidence against the former club doorman to fit their "ludicrous theory"."The sad truth is that police are no nearer to solving the mystery of the disappearance of Milly Dowler now in 2011 than they were in 2002 at the time, or any time since," said Samuels, in his closing speech to an Old Bailey jury."The crime that shocked the nation remaining unsolved represents an uncomfortable position. So you may think that prosecuting this defendant, who has little to lose, presents them with an opportunity that gives them everything to gain."Bellfield, 43, from West Drayton, Middlesex, denies the abduction and murder of Milly, 13, who disappeared as she walked home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, on 21 March 2002. The former wheel clamper also denies the attempted abduction of Rachel Cowles, then 11, in nearby Shepperton, the previous day.Samuels said "virtually all of the evidence" presented had been available to police when Bellfield was first arrested over Milly's death in 2005, but not charged.He questioned why Bellfield had not been tried in 2007, when he was accused and convicted of the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, in 2004, Marsha McDonnell, 19, in 2003 and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004.The jury might think that reflected the "weakness" of the case, and that "deficiencies of evidence in this case" could be covered "by parading him before you as a convicted murderer, the local serial killer", said Samuels.The prosecution had tried to make the evidence fit, with the "pegs whittled away in order that even the square ones can fit into the round holes", he added.There was "undue reliance" on Bellfield's convictions, and an "artificial attempt to suggest similarities when in fact none exist".Milly, a schoolgirl, disappeared in daytime, while the victims Bellfield was convicted of murdering were "young women" attacked at night. Milly's body had been moved to Yateley Heath Woods, Hampshire, where her remains were discovered six months later, while the others were left at the spot, said Samuels.The other attacks were said to involve "sudden explosive anger", while in this case Bellfield was alleged to have enticed or lured Milly to his rented flat nearby.The prosecution theory was "pure fantasy", said Samuels, and the jury would not be "doing a service to the Dowler family, still less to Milly's memory, by convicting this man, however unattractive he may be".The hearing continues.
