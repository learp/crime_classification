A man who was part of a food company that fraudulently claimed to be supplying organic products was jailed for 27 months. One Food Limited, of Daventry, Northamptonshire, claimed to sell "organic, natural and ethical" products, but they contained non-organic ingredients, Trading Standards officers said. It emerged the company bosses had bought non-organic ingredients from supermarkets, and even got employees to re-bag them. At Northampton crown court director Neil Stansfield, 41, of Newnham, was jailed. Two others received lesser sentences. All three had pleaded guilty.
