The head of Rochdale council will be questioned by MPs over why his social workers "missed opportunities" to stop the sexual exploitation of young girls, it has emerged, as a lawyer for some of the victims said it was "very likely" they would take legal action against the local authority.A critical review into child protection in the area was released on Thursday and Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said he had been "deeply concerned" at its findings. He said the council's chief executive, Jim Taylor, would be summoned to appear before MPs."As part of its ongoing inquiry into grooming, the committee will be recalling the chief executive of Rochdale council to explain why social services missed opportunities to stop the exploitation of vulnerable girls, what is being done to ensure agencies are now working together to keep them safe and how individuals responsible for the failings will be held to account," he said.Taylor previously faced MPs on the committee in June, a month after a group of nine men were convicted of the systematic grooming and sexual abuse of five teenage girls in and around Rochdale, Greater Manchester.It was in the wake of revelations concerning their activities – which involved "sharing" the girls and using them for sex – that Rochdale Borough Safeguarding Children Board (RBSCB) ordered a review into child sexual exploitation in the area and the work of local agencies to stop it.The review, published on Thursday, covered the period from 2007 until this year. It found "many missed opportunities" by child welfare organisations and the criminal justice system to protect children and young people from sexual exploitation and that "patchy" training of frontline social care staff had caused "clear deficiencies" in responses.It revealed that, in 2007, a working group set up by the RBSCB had identified 50 young people – most aged between 10 and 17 – whom it believed to be affected by or at risk of exploitation.Figures obtained separately by the Guardian showed social workers and police had made dozens of referrals concerning girls considered either to be victims or potential victims.The findings have sparked anger from victims and their families. Richard Scorer, a solicitor for some of the girls, told ITV's Daybreak: "I think based on the evidence in this report it is very likely that we will be going forward with legal action. It is fairly unusual for social services to be sued. It does happen but it is fairly unusual."His clients, he said, were "deeply traumatised and distressed" by what had happened to them."But they want to have the opportunity to rebuild their lives, the means, the wherewithal to do that, and that of course is part of the reason for bringing this case."What they also want to see is some cultural change in social services and hopefully the report is the first stage of that, but they want to press home that point and the legal action is part of achieving that."Rochdale council said it had put in place recommendations from the review, including the briefing of more than 10,000 staff on recognition and response to sexual exploitation and a rolling programme of face-to-face training.Taylor has said he deeply regrets the findings of the report, which looked not only at the actions of the council but also of bodies including the police, NHS and Crown Prosecution Service. He refused on Thursday to respond immediately to demands for "heads to roll" over the scandal."I think that an investigation that I have instigated will actually bring out these particular facts," he said, adding he had commissioned an internal review which would report next month.
