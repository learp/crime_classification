CCTV film of a point-blank shooting outside a nightclub was released by police yesterday after the gunman was jailed for 11 years.Less than three feet separate the handgun muzzle of Leighton Bennett from his victim, Damien Ralph, who escaped death because the .38 bullet missed a main artery by a centimetre. Bennett fired with chilling calculation in a busy street, Leeds crown court was told, before walking away, confident that onlookers would not come forward as witnesses. But another camera shot had already caught his face clearly beneath his hoodie, and he was recognised and arrested by a police officer near his home in Coventry several weeks later. Bennett, 23, had driven 120 miles from the Midlands to Leeds in January with friends, the court heard, before settling on Rhythms nightclub in Chapeltown as a place to do "a bit of business". But a quarrel was triggered, possibly because local suppliers failed to come up with any drugs, and the argument spilled outside. Christopher Batty, prosecuting, said someone had given Bennett the weapon as fighting on the pavement got worse. David Jackson, for Bennett, who admitted attempted murder, said someone had stolen Â£60 from Bennett's pocket and he was frightened and nervous. He regretted using the gun.
