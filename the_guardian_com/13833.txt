Learco Chindamo, the killer of headteacher Philip Lawrence, cannot be deported to Italy when he is released from jail, a senior high court judge confirmed yesterday.Mr Justice Collins rejected the government's attempt to appeal against an asylum and immigration tribunal decision last August that Chindamo, 27, must be allowed to remain in Britain.Ministers blamed the Human Rights Act and announced an appeal amid a furore over the ruling last August. In fact, the decision was based mainly on immigration rules, which say a national of an EU state who has resided in the UK for 10 years cannot be deported except on "imperative grounds of public security".The regulations, which were brought in to comply with an EU directive, also say that any decision to deport must comply with principles of proportionality and "a person's previous criminal convictions do not in themselves justify the decision".Yesterday's ruling will be a blow to the immigration minister, Liam Byrne, who says the government wants foreign nationals who commit serious crimes to be automatically deported. A decision to deport automatically would be unlawful if the criminal is an EU citizen, according to lawyers.Although born in Italy, Chindamo has lived in the UK since the age of six. He was 15 when, in 1995, he stabbed Mr Lawrence, who was trying to protect another pupil at the gates of his west London school. He was jailed in 1996 and becomes eligible for parole next year.
