David Cameron continued his political balancing act yesterday, as he appealed to leftwing voters by outlining plans for a youth volunteering programme and then to traditional Tories, as he floated reforms to make the police more effective.Children's campaigners praised his "hug a hoodie" initiative yesterday, with one charity describing his demand for Britons to "show a lot more love" to young people as a wake-up call to government.The Conservative leader's remarks came as the former director general of the Prison Service, Martin Narey, now head of Barnardo's, used an interview with the Times to attack the government for demonising children.Clare Tickell, chief executive of children's charity NCH, said the Tories were right to challenge negative portrayals of young people, who were more likely to be victims than perpetrators of offences.Penny Nicholls, director of strategy for the Children's Society, said: "David Cameron's remarks are a wake-up call for the Labour government and society ... Current draconian measures to curb youth crime are not offering lasting solutions, only creating further problems." But Labour said Tories in Birmingham had campaigned for a possible ban on hoodies from shopping centres and cinemas at the local elections.Mr Cameron also said he would soon unveil a pilot programme for the national school leaver project he has proposed. Twenty charities, including the Prince's Trust and the Duke of Edinburgh's Awards, have worked on developing the scheme. But Labour sources suggested it would duplicate a charity launched in May by the government that aims to recruit one million volunteers between the ages of 16 and 25.Mr Cameron followed his speech to the Centre for Social Justice with one to the Police Foundation in which he floated the idea of separating anti-terrorism units from the police, either by creating a stand-alone national agency or expanding the responsibilities of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. He argued police would be more effective if given more freedom from central targets, adding: "The [public] want the police to be crime fighters, not form writers. They want the police to be a force as well as a service."Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and founder of the Centre for Social Justice, agreed that Mr Cameron's dual messages echoed Mr Blair's "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime" slogan, but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the prime minister had failed to put his words into action.Privately Conservative MPs suggested that Mr Cameron's speech to the Police Foundation was an attempt to reassure rightwingers in the parliamentary party, who might otherwise have revolted over his earlier speech. Hazel Blears, the Labour party chair, claimed the Tory leader was out of touch, adding: "He continues to oppose Labour's measures both to tackle crime and to tackle its causes."David Cameron attacks Sure Start and opposes policies such as the New Deal and tax credits which are lifting children out of poverty and also Labour's Respect action plan, which gives police and communities new powers to tackle antisocial behaviour ...".
