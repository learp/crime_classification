Hundreds of friends and family of Ben Kinsella, the 16-year-old who was stabbed to death on Sunday morning, marched through the streets of London today demanding an end to knife crime.The 400-strong group stopped outside the home of London mayor Boris Johnson, claiming he had not contacted them over the killing."This is where Boris Johnson lives and he hasn't bothered to get in touch with us," one of the group yelled, adding sarcastically, "he cares about London".Johnson, who placed a strong focus on tackling knife and gun crime during the mayoral election campaign, and lives close to the scene of Ben's murder, said today: "I understand the strength of feeling and indeed welcome this public expression of hostility towards the hideous problem of knife crime in our city.''I deeply regret that another young person has lost their life to violence and my thoughts are with the family of this young man."Protesters wore white t-shirts with messages saying "fallen soldier, rest in paradise" and "don't use a knife, get a life" as they marched through Islington in front of a banner, which was written in blood red paint: "Why Ben?" Four people aged in their late teens were arrested this morning in connection with Ben's murder.This afternoon the march stopped outside the front of the Shillibeers bar, where the 16-year-old was stabbed to death on Sunday.The teenager had gone to the bar in Carpenters Mews, North Road, Islington, on Saturday night to celebrate finishing their GCSEs.Trouble broke out and some customers were told to leave.It is believed Ben was then stabbed in the torso several times in York Way, near the junction with North Road.Brooke Dunford, 16, who organised today's march had printed leaflets, sent emails and text messages, and used Facebook to let everyone know about the protest, which began at Islington Town Hall.She wore a t-shirt with "18?" written on it, as a reference to whether she could be the 18th teenager knifed to death in London this year."It's ridiculous. When is it going to stop? I never thought it would happen to such a good boy. Someone who never had a bad bone in his body. "If by doing this today I have made one person rethink taking out a knife then I have done my bit. That would be one more person going back home to his mum."Linda Robson, the Birds of a Feather actress, also joined the march, with her 16-year-old son Louis, who had cradled Ben in his arms as he lay dying. Robson said the families had been in close contact since Ben's death. "Brooke [Ben's sister] sent a lovely text to my daughter saying, 'I haven't got a brother now, can we borrow yours some time'."Earlier today, the Metropolitan police said one of the four suspects was arrested at a house in Islington yesterday afternoon. Two were detained at a house in Chadwell Heath, east London, late last night and the fourth at a house in Bethnal Green, also in east London, this morning.Two 16-year-old boys arrested earlier were released on police bail yesterday.Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald, of the homicide and serious crime command, said: "We have had a good response to our appeals so far."But we are still keen to speak to witnesses - in particular anyone who saw the stabbing itself, or anyone who has information about the identity of the suspects."If you can help, please contact us as soon as possible."Ben's family yesterday described him as "a true angel" as they appealed for young people to lay down their weapons.His sister, Brooke Kinsella, a former EastEnders actor, read a statement paying tribute to "one of the kindest, gentlest and most talented boys God has ever created"."Ben was the 17th teenager to be killed in London this year, and our hearts go out to every family who has also suffered this awful tragedy," she said. "Now truly is the time to stand up and put an end to this."Please, please, let us learn from Ben and every other child that has been stolen from us."The 24-year-old said she, her parents, Deborah and George, and her sisters, Jade and Georgia, were determined to ensure that the streets were made safe again."Please, boys and girls, put down your knives and weapons and think about the pain and suffering they will cause," she said. "Parents, please talk to your children and encourage them to stop all this violence."It emerged today that Ben had recently written an essay for a school creative writing task in which he described dying from a stab wound.Yesterday, police recovered two knives from the area close to where he was killed, but Scotland Yard would not say whether they were connected with the attack.Anyone with information is asked to call 020 8345 3985 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
