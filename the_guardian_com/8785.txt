The home secretary, John Reid, has suspended plans to double the maximum sentences handed out by magistrates.Under a scheme devised by David Blunkett in 2002, JPs would have been able to jail offenders for 12 months.Those powers became law in 2003, and were due to come into force this November but have now been indefinitely suspended pending a review.The news of the postponement of the plan came in a little-noticed paragraph in a Home Office paper, Rebalancing the Criminal Justice System, published last month and picked up in today's Daily Telegraph.The reason for the shelving of the plans, according to the Home Office, is that the same powers also allowed for a new scheme of "custody-plus" - allowing courts to impose a short jail term followed by a longer community service - which is not now being implemented this autumn "given the need to prioritise prison and probation resources on more serious offenders".The Home Office said this meant the new sentencing powers would need to be reviewed.A spokeswoman said: "The decision to defer custody-plus means that implementation of other related powers in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including the increase in magistrates' sentencing powers and procedural reforms, will be reviewed."An announcement will be made in the autumn."Plans to train the 29,000 magistrates in England and Wales to use the new powers were also abandoned.Cindy Barnett, chairman of the Magistrates' Association, told the Telegraph there had been rumours that the Probation Service would not have enough resources to provide the community service element of custody-plus.She said: "We were disappointed that the decision was made so late. We have been making preparations for 18 months."Magistrates were fired up, with training dates in their diaries. It's a pity that such a massive training programme has simply gone."The original powers, contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, were due to come into force on November 6 in a bid to relieve the crown courts by dealing with more cases locally.Although the brainchild of Mr Blunkett, they also had the backing of his successor, Charles Clarke, and in May, Mr Reid told the Sentencing Guidelines Council that he had no objections to the plans.
