Several ducks, geese and a moorhen have been shot dead at a village pond. An air rifle was used to kill the birds in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, between Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon. A Hampshire police spokesman said: “During this time period, an unknown number of people have used an air rifle or something similar to shoot dead the majority of birds at the pond. “The birds that died are described as two recently born geese, two wild ducks, a female Muscovy duck and one moorhen. Another duck had been shot in the head but was recovered by a member of the public and taken to the local vets. It is expected to make a full recovery.” PC Geoff Hill, of Farnborough police station, said: “It is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to kill, injure or take any wild bird. The duck pond is at the heart of the village and has provided amusement for generations of families. It is disgusting that someone should curtail this by killing innocent and defenceless wildlife.”
