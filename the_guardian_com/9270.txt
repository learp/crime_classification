Thousands of marchers converged on London today for a peace rally in response to the recent wave of stabbings across the country.Victims of violent crime and families of young people who have died in knife attacks, including the actress Brooke Kinsella, whose brother Ben was murdered in June, were among crowds that gathered at Hyde Park this afternoon.Traffic was stopped as marchers made their way to the rally from Kennington Park in the south and Caledonian Road in the north of the city, accompanied by a gospel choir and chants of "stop the knives, save lives". Applause and cheers greeted the two processions as they joined at the Eros statue in Piccadilly Circus.The Hyde Park event featured video messages from the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and the opposition leader, David Cameron, along with live music and speakers.The so-called People's March was the brainchild of two south London women, Sharon Singh and Gemma Olway, both 26, who first set up a group on the social networking site Facebook before joining with the families of young people who had been murdered and the Damilola Taylor Trust.Richard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son, Damilola, was stabbed to death in a stairwell on a housing estate in south London in 2000, said: "We are sending a message to young people that they have not been forgotten and that we care but we are also not happy with them resolving minor disputes and fighting over issues and then using a knife."Barry Mizen, the father of Jimmy Mizen, who was stabbed to death during an attack at a bakery in May, said he was "encouraged by the fact there are so many people here raising awareness of the issue"."I am more than glad to be here today if it helps make a difference and in memory of our son. If we do nothing it will just get worse."
