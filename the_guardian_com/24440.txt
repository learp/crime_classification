Thai police investigating the murder of a British woman in the resort of Phuket last night arrested the victim's boyfriend.The body of Debra O'Hanlon, a 31-year-old primary school teacher, was found in a guesthouse at the beach resort of Patong in Phuket early yesterday morning.Ms O'Hanlon, 31, from Northamptonshire, had suffered a broken neck, stab wounds in the back of her head, and bruises covering her face and body, police said.It appeared that she had struggled with her attacker.Police last night arrested Paul Chetwynd-Talbot, the British owner of local bar in the resort. Lieutenant Padungpong Duksukkaew told the Associated Press that the Briton had been taken into custody.He said Mr Chetwynd-Talbot had slashed his wrists in a suicide attempt, and was being treated in a local hospital.The couple had opened a bar in Patong last year but closed it and returned to England after the Boxing Day tsunami devastated the island's tourist industry. Detectives believe Mr Chetwynd-Talbot returned to Phuket about a month ago to reopen the bar and that Ms O'Hanlon flew out last week.A Foreign Office spokeswoman said embassy staff were liaising with the Thai police and the dead woman's family.Ms O'Hanlon had taught at King's Cliffe Endowed school, in Peterborough, according to the Press Association, and it is understood that she had been due to start work as acting deputy headteacher at Wollaston school, in Wellingborough. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, told the Press Association she was not aware Ms O'Hanlon had returned to Thailand."She was there for the tsunami, she saw all that, but I did not know she had gone back there," the woman was quoted as saying."She went away for a while and then I saw her a couple of months ago and she was telling me what she'd been doing in Thailand. She was a lovely girl, really bubbly. She said she had got this new job and she was quite excited, but she didn't tell me she was going away."Rachel Dempster, headteacher at King's Cliffe and former deputy head at Woodnewton junior school, said: "Debra was a very, very talented, powerful and gifted teacher. She had everything to live for. She had worked for me since Easter at King's Cliffe, and was a very committed, dedicated teacher who will be very sadly missed."Ms O'Hanlon's father, Malcolm, said the family was too distressed to speak about his daughter's death.Her mother and sister, Patricia and Julie, were being comforted at the family home in Wellingborough yesterday.
