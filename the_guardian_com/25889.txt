The government has now set out plans to make community sentences "credible, robust and demanding punishment". Setting out its proposals on the future of the probation service, the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, said "good sentencing is a combination of firm punishment and effective reform of the offender".In trailing some of the ideas prior to the official annoucment, the prime minister was wrong to label existing community sentences as "soft". Community orders are already more effective than short custodial sentences at reducing reoffending. The Ministry of Justice's own figures show that court-ordered community sentences are 8% better at reducing one-year proven reoffending rates than custodial sentences of less than 12 months for similar offences and similar offenders. Since this research monitored like-for-like offenders, the criticism often levelled that prison and community are not comparable is not justified in this case.In addition, 40% of 18- to 24-year-olds who received a community sentence in 2009 reoffended within a one-year follow-up period, compared with a reoffending rate of 52.8% for the same age group who were released from prison that year. Some offenders themselves report that community penalties can be more demanding than sleeping their way through a few weeks in prison. This doesn't mean that prison is easy, but it is largely unable to do more than warehouse those offenders on short sentences, owing to severe overcrowding and high levels of churn throughout the system.The centrepiece of the proposals is greater enforcement, in the form of tags, longer curfew orders and enforced sobriety. But the MoJ's own impact assessment, published alongside the proposals, admits that UK evidence on electronic tags indicates a likely "neutral impact" on reoffending. This raises the question of why this new package focuses on these external control measures to the exclusion of what we know helps people go straight, such as strong family relationships, taking responsibility and constructive supervision or mentoring.Despite increasing evidence that desistance requires a fundamental change in people's attitudes alongside real opportunities such as employment to turn their lives around, what really helps people to stop offending seems to have been sidelined – a notable exception being the welcome expansion of restorative justice, which can reduce reoffending by between 14% and 27%, repair harm in local communities and help some victims to feel a sense of closure.It is disappointing that the government is now shying away from promoting community sentences as viable alternatives to short prison sentences. This seems a retreat from earlier, more reforming talk. Failure to ensure community sentences are used instead of custody for non-violent offenders could simply escalate people through the prison system, and in the end lock more people into a cycle of crime. Community sentences are a particularly more effective way to administer justice for the many groups with complex needs that fill up our justice system – those with mental health problems, drug and alcohol addictions and vulnerable women, many of whom have been victims of crime themselves.We many look back and see this announcement as the time when the window of opportunity for the radical reform of our justice system banged shut.• Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree
