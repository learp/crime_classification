Barry George has said he could not have killed Jill Dando because he was stalking another woman at the time of the shooting.An Old Bailey jury on Friday cleared the 48-year-old of murdering the TV presenter, eight years after he was jailed for the crime.Detectives investigating the killing became increasingly convinced George was the gunman after they discovered he had followed numerous women and taken thousands of pictures of them.But in a joint interview with Sky News and the News of the World, George insisted that at the time Dando was murdered, he was following another woman after leaving a disability centre in Fulham.Dando was shot dead on her doorstep in Fulham, west London, at around 11.30am on April 26 1999.Between 10.30am and 12.33pm on the day of the shooting he was either at the centre or walking beside the woman, George said."I walked with her for a bit and from her perspective, maybe it was unwanted attention. But she didn't make that clear," he said."It didn't seem like she was telling me to go away. If she'd told me to leave I'd have done so straight away."That was at 12.33pm. I know because just a minute before I'd made a call from my mobile to check how much credit I had left."During three weeks of surveillance before his arrest George was seen to approach 38 women and try to make conversation with them.He said of his history of stalking: "I know I have done wrong in the past and if I could go back in time and change that I would."Dando, 37, was a BBC TV presenter at the height of her fame when she was shot in the head at her home in Gowan Avenue.George's defence team argued in court that he lacked the capability to carry out the meticulously-planned execution-style killing.Scans of his brain showed "severely abnormal" results and some tests placed him in the lowest 1% of the population for his memory and planning abilities.He said he was bitter at the eight years he spent behind bars: "I've missed out on so much. I should have been getting on with my life. Who knows what I could have done and achieved?"The Sunday Mirror quoted George as saying he realised his history of pestering women had fuelled police suspicion about him, and promised to change his behaviour."I don't want to spend any more time in any of Her Majesty's holiday camps ... I won't follow women anymore. I know it's wrong," he said."I will be vigilant from now on. I am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again. I have changed."Nearly 10 years on, the killer of Dando remains at large and the shooting could now be the subject of a cold case review.Police may re-examine the huge body of evidence amassed in the investigation into the Crimewatch presenter's murder.Detectives have more than 2,500 witness statements and 3,700 exhibits to trawl in the hope of finding a fresh clue that leads them to the true culprit.George is now expected to seek compensation for the eight years he spent in prison, which experts believe could be at least Â£250,000.His barrister, William Clegg QC, said he thought the intense publicity the case attracted put pressure on the police to catch the perpetrator, and this distorted their approach to the case."I think the lesson really is that in considering a case of this complexity, the police and those responsible for the prosecution, need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who might be responsible [for the crime]," he said."I think they did close their mind after the arrest of Barry George."The retrial heard that George was known as the "local nutter" who was obsessed with the rock band Queen. He called himself Barry Bulsara, after the real name of the band's lead singer Freddie Mercury.In 1983 he was arrested hiding in bushes outside Kensington Palace in an attempt to see Diana, Princess of Wales.But the prosecution lacked direct evidence of his involvement and no witnesses were able to identify him as the killer.
