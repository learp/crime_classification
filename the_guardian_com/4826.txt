The law on prostitution could be changed to allow small "worker-run" brothels involving two or three women so they can protect themselves, the government announced yesterday.Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she also wanted to replace the "ineffective" fine for soliciting with an intervention penalty that ensured prostitutes received help with drug or alcohol problems. She also intends to stop the women being branded a "common prostitute" by the courts on the grounds that the phrase is outdated and offensive.The new strategy represents the first big overhaul of the laws surrounding prostitution in nearly 50 years. The Home Office estimates that 80,000 people are involved in the vice trade, with 95% of the women dependent on heroin or crack.Ms Mactaggart confirmed yesterday that the Home Office had dropped plans floated last year by the former home secretary, David Blunkett, to allow red-light "toleration zones" and a system of licensed sex workers who undergo regular health checks."I cannot accept that we should turn a blind eye to a problem that causes misery for people living in or near red-light areas," she said. "There is no evidence that decriminalisation or licensing prostitution would achieve our objectives of reducing exploitation, improving the safety of those involved and making communities safer."As disclosed in the Guardian last month the government's strategy includes a national campaign against kerb crawlers, with compulsory re-education classes paid for by first-time offenders, a renewed drive against street prostitution and measures to prevent children entering prostitution.Ms Mactaggart justified the decision to relax the law on brothels as a necessary harm-reduction measure and insisted that two or three women working together in a flat could operate in a way that was not disruptive to neighbours. "We are not going to eradicate prostitution overnight. At present only one person may work as a prostitute - more than that (and that can include a "maid") and the premises are classed in law as a brothel. We think that women who work in pairs are safer than those who work alone," she said.The heavy penalties for brothel-keeping would be reserved for those premises managed by pimps or using trafficked women: "It is a matter of exploitation. Where women are working for themselves and are less likely to be managed or pimped on a large scale it is probably more sensible not to use the very serious penalties we have against people who run brothels."Very small-scale operations can operate in a way that is not disruptive to neighbours," she added. The new "rehab" penalty for soliciting or loitering for the purposes of prostitution would end the use of fines which only encouraged women to go back out on to the street to earn the money to pay the fine. So-called "ugly mug" schemes are also to be extended to protect prostitutes against known violent punters.Martin Narey of Barnardo's, the child protection charity, welcomed the strategy, saying it would help those who were trapped in prostitution to find a way out.But Ana Lopez, president of the sex workers branch of the GMB union, said the government had not taken the opportunity to go down a more enlightened path towards regulation."The government has decided to continue to promote the stereotyped and cliched view of sex workers. GMB members who work in the sex industry know, as does the government, that the majority of sex workers, including those who work in prostitution, are not typical of the drug addict victims that everyone loves to hate. "Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said mini-brothels were not the answer: "The government is willing to turn a blind eye to 'small brothels' but unwilling to create a system of proper health checks and legal safeguards for the women who work there. This is the worst of both worlds. The honest way forward would be to set up pilot schemes to look at ways of regulating brothels instead of pretending they don't exist."Main points· Change definition of brothel so that two or three prostitutes can work safely together· Replace fines for soliciting for prostitution with exit strategy "rehab" orders· Concerted campaign against kerb-crawling, including re-education classes· Abolish "stigmatising" term of common prostitute· New measures to prevent children getting involved in prostitution
