The case against Harold Shipman, the GP accused of murdering 15 women patients, is based on unreliable scientific evidence, Preston crown court was told yesterday.In her closing speech to the jury, Nicola Davies QC, defending, said the forensic scientist working on the case had broken new ground. There was no comparable data available, and the samples were taken from the alleged victims' bodies after death, so they could have been subjected to changes. She claimed that the prosecution had failed to produce a motive. She said Shipman had been a caring GP since the 1970s. "With a list size of 3,100, well above the national average, Dr Shipman must have been doing something right." Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, denies murdering the patients and forging the Â£386,000 will of one. Miss Davies said: "The prosecution case is built on one foundation stone and that is toxicology. Without it there would be no case. Toxicology is a new science and untested by proven scientific methods." She said the discrepancies in Dr Shipman's records, which the prosecution claimed he used to cover his tracks, were more in keeping with an eccentric practice than a cunning murderer. The trial continues today.
