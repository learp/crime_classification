Thefts of valuable gadgets from cars have doubled in a year, according to a survey published yesterday.Satellite navigation systems - or satnavs - have become a target with more than 260,000 stolen in 2005. The cost to the average driver of a break-in is now Â£646, a 13% increase on last year's figure.One third of satnav owners admit to leaving the cradle of their machine on display, and 10% leave the whole system in place, even when their vehicle is parked in public.The number of respondents who said equipment had been taken from their car was twice as high as last year, with 41% reporting that gadgets such as as satnavs, laptops, stereos, MP3 players and mobile phones had been stolen from them.Autoglass, which commissioned the poll, warned that the New Year tends to see an increase in vehicle-related theft - the company said side-window replacements rose 17% in the first three months of 2006.Crime surveys often paint a different picture of theft to government statistics because many victims of crime choose not to report incidents. "Our research shows that 15% of vehicle owners leave their valuables in full view and 28% think that hiding things under the seats or in the door pockets is a good enough deterrent," said Nigel Doggett, managing director of Autoglass. "While break-ins are nothing new, the high-priced gadgets available today are proving too much of a temptation for thieves."
