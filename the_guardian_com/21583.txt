Detectives were investigating today after a "home-made" explosive device was sent to a Labour party office.The "crude" device arrived at the Cambridge Labour party's office in Cambridge yesterday, police said.A member of staff became suspicious, alerted the emergency services and no-one was hurt. But a senior officer said the device - which is being examined by experts - could have caused injury had it gone off. In April, burning paper was pushed through a letterbox at the at the same office and an envelope containing a harmless white powder was delivered. Chief superintendent Rob Needle said a number of organisations and individuals had also been sent "hate mail" in recent weeks - but he refused to give any more details. "We are mounting an urgent investigation as to whether these incidents are linked," he said. "Our main concern is that people should be alert in case there are any more of these explosive devices in the post. "People should take extra care in opening post and alert us if they have any suspicions." He said there was no suggestion that any major terrorist group was involved and the inquiry was centred on Cambridge. The Met's anti-terrorist branch was not involved in the investigation. Chief Supt Needle said the device arrived in a package inside a padded envelope and the address was handwritten.
