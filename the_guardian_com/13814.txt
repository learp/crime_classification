What is most sickening about the fraudulent recruitment of students at the public expense by so-called “private higher education providers” (Thousands of ‘fake’ students at new colleges, 2 December) is that they do not seem to be subject to the draconian security monitoring and anti-student visa restrictions imposed on the UK’s mainstream universities. At the Institute of Development Studies, based at the University of Sussex, for instance, one of Britain’s top international universities, we have had to stop recruiting senior Indian civil servants for our MA programme because they got fed up with constant visa difficulties and being treated like criminals trying to get into some backstreet bogus language school. One of my PhD students from Ghana, who had spent four years studying full-time in the UK, on a Commonwealth scholarship, was last year refused a visa to come back for his own graduation.Universities are one of Britain’s top export earners, yet they are being undermined and harassed by the excessive “anti-terror” monitoring requirements and by routine refusal to grant visas, in the name of an immigration control policy that is clearly driven by populist anti-foreigner hysteria and now the rise of Ukip. Yet the private, clearly fraudulent, colleges continue to evade these controls – and get public subsidy into the bargain.
