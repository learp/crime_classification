One of Ireland’s most prominent anti-abortion activists has been found guilty of harassing the head of Belfast’s Marie Stopes clinic.A judge at the city’s magistrates court warned the Precious Life director Bernadette Smyth that she could face jail for her protests against the former Progressive Unionist party leader Dawn Purvis and the clinic.The deputy district judge Chris Holmes said the campaign of harassment had been carried out “in a vicious and malicious fashion”.Smyth was told she would have to pay compensation and would be barred from the area around the clinic on Great Victoria Street in Belfast.The Marie Stopes clinic in the city has been picketed frequently by Precious Life and other anti-abortion groups since it opened two years ago.The 51-year-old anti-abortion campaigner had denied she was involved in ongoing harassment towards Purvis.In a scathing ruling, the judge said: “I want to make it absolutely clear that I do not feel it is appropriate for anyone to be stopped outside this clinic in any form, shape or fashion and questioned either as to their identity or why they are going in there and being forced to involve themselves in conversation at times when they are almost certainly going to be stressed and very possibly distressed.”Turning to how the defence was run, he said: “Throughout this case there has been a concerted attack on anyone seen as getting in the way of Mrs Smyth.”Giving evidence in the case, Purvis said she was left frightened for her safety following two incidents.During an exchange with protesters on 9 January this year, the clinic director said she had put her hand up and asked them to stop harassing her. Smyth was said to have replied in an exaggerated drawl: “You ain’t seen harassment yet, darling.”Smyth originally denied to police having used the word harassment, but on viewing CCTV footage of the incident she accepted it had been said as a joke.The second alleged incident occurred on 13 February after Purvis’s son called at her office with a female friend. Purvis said that as she walked them out of the centre, one of the protesters followed the girl up the street.According to her account, Smyth, of Suffolk Street in Ballymena, then started to cackle menacingly.But the defendant claimed she was set up, having just been served with a police notice warning of potential action for harassment. She alleged that Purvis “growled” at her through the clinic front door in a bid to provoke a reaction.The Precious Life founder rejected the prosecution’s contention that she “cackled like a witch”, saying her laughter was fuelled by nerves and anxiety.Smyth left court without making a comment, but her solicitor Aidan Carlin described the verdict as “a disappointment for Christians worldwide”.He also confirmed plans to mount an appeal against the conviction.
