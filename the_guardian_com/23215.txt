Five people were arrested this week for their roles in an internet ticket scam that left thousands of fans without the festival passes they had paid for. London's Metropolitan Police swooped into three homes and one business on Tuesday night, arresting four men and a woman.All were thought to be connected with Xclusive Tickets Ltd and Xclusive Leisure and Hospitality Ltd – xcrable, xtremely nefarious organisations that claimed to sell tickets to events like the V and Reading festivals, and even the Beijing Olympic Games, but who allegedly ran off with the cash.More than 4,000 fans were conned, according to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).The scam was carried out on websites such as bejingticketing.com – non-official ticket brokers that event organisers had warned fans against using. After receiving payment for more than 4,000 tickets, the Xclusive companies were placed into liquidation, the SFO said, essentially disappearing. Authorities began their investigation after members of the public from more than 60 countries made complaints, claiming to have paid for tickets without receiving anything in return.Richard Alderman, director of the SFO, called on duped fans to get in touch with his office via an online form. The five suspects, aged between 41 and 54, were questioned and released on bail.
