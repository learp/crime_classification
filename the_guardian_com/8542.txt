New details have emerged revealing that the German GP who killed a patient accidentally during his first shift in the UK was told to go back to Germany "asap" by his locum employment agency.Daniel Ubani was also told to leave by the out-of-hours service for which he worked as medics and police began unravelling the truth behind a disastrous 12-hour shift in which he administered a fatal overdose of a painkiller to 70-year-old David Gray. The NHS watchdog is investigating what it has called "a deeply disturbing case" which saw Ubani being prosecuted and convicted in Germany. But he is continuing to practise in his home country even though he has been suspended from working in the UK.The Guardian has now learned that moves to make Ubani retake his medical examinations have begun in Germany. However, there are no plans to try to strike him off the German medical register.Ubani, who was subject to a manslaughter investigation by Cambridgeshire police after the accident in the village of Manea in February 2008, subsequently sent the Gray family a letter of apology, saying he had been tired and using a drug he was not familiar with. The Crown Prosecution Service has confirmed there will be no action taken against Ubani in this country but the Guardian has seen documents, including some likely to play a part in a coroner's inquiry, which reveal:• Take Care Now (TCN), the out-of-hours service for the area, and Cimarron, the locum agency that supplied Ubani to TCN, both advised the doctor to go home when police began to investigate what was then being treated as a sudden death.• A lawyer for the GMC, which registers doctors in the UK and checks credentials of foreign doctors before they are allowed to work here, suggested that "this doctor was simply not suited to conducting this kind of call-out and conducting … this type of work in the UK", when urging his suspension days after the incident.• Ubani pleaded in mitigation that he had practised as a doctor for 21 years and that suspension from practising in the UK would be "very harsh and very hard". He said "a milder step should be taken".• Explaining why he had applied to work as a locum in the UK, he said in Germany, "there is a very harsh political assessment of doctors' earnings" and "most doctors cannot financially meet the overhead costs of their practice". Most doctors left Germany, either to resettle before continuing their practice or to do what he had done. "There are quite a number of German colleagues in this country that do out-of-hours calls".• Sharon Brooks, a director at Cimarro, while having no concerns about Ubani's prescribing ability or ability as a doctor, told police: "Past experience of foreign doctors, especially those from Germany, has taught me that they have no budgetary restraint with regards to prescribing drugs such as antibiotics and sometimes cost the local primary care trust a small fortune by over-subscribing the amount needed by the patient."Brooks, who contacted Ubani the day after he killed Gray to tell him not to finish his shift, said the doctor had been shocked. In police evidence, she said he rang back later to say a senior member of staff at TCN had told him "it was probably best he go home to Germany but he wasn't sure he could get a flight. I told him to go home to Germany asap and if he needed to, he could call me any time".Both TCN and Cimarron declined to discuss the matters in detail when contacted last week. TCN's chief executive David Cox would only say in a statement: "These are questions that we understand the coroner will look at and believe that is the right forum to answer them, in a broader context."Cimarron referred the Guardian to its statement issued in May which that said it had "robust processes" to assure appropriate checks were in place and that it had fully co-operated with investigations into the case.Ubani's solicitor, Reinhard Schauwienald, said: "We have no interest in talking to the British press about this. We're not going to pass on any information about it, least of all to the Guardian."According to a spokesman for the German Medical Chamber in Westfalen-Lippe, responsible for Witten, where Ubani has his practice, the municipal government in Arnsberg, which holds the ultimate power to decide over his future, has decided not to withdraw his licence to practice.How the story unfoldedNovember 2006 Daniel Ubani, a German doctor of Nigerian origin, added to the GP register of the General Medical Council.July 2007 Ubani accepted on the performers' list for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly primary care trust, giving him the entree to work in the UK.February 16 2008 Ubani accidentally kills 70-year-old David Gray on a house call in Cambridgeshire, on his first UK shift as a locum.February 17 2008 Sent home "asap" by locum agency that hired him.February 29 2008 Ubani attends GMC hearing in London.
