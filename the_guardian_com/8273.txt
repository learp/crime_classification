The naming and shaming of subjects of anti-social behaviour orders won narrow backing yesterday at Labour's latest "big conversation" exercise in Salford.The session, organised by the Home Office minister Hazel Blears, was attended by 110 people including policemen and magistrates. Ms Blears said that there was also strong support for the principle of identity cards, as well as extending the principle fixed penalty notices for specific criminal offences. She said the single biggest theme of the day was not to blame tearaway children, but instead to look to solutions with the parents who had often failed to raise their children properly. Ms Blears said that there had been narrow support for the idea of the council distributing thousands of photographs of anyone handed an anti-social behaviour order by the courts. More ASBOs, often banning an individual from an area at certain times of the day, have been issued in Salford than anywhere else in Britain. The photographs are seen as a way of inflicting punishment on anyone convicted, and also giving the community a tool with which to enforce the orders.Ms Blears said: "Better parenting is a big idea for this government, but we have to find a way in which we address the issue that it does not just become about government coercion." The government is introducing mandatory parenting orders for families of tearaway children. However, Ms Blears said that poor parents needed to be encouraged to become involved in such courses voluntarily. The government is facing a wall of scepticism about the value of the big conversation, but the prime minister is due to travel to Yorkshire today to hold another big conversation session, probably with the home secretary David Blunkett.
