A bogus bond dealer swindled an investor while donating millions to the Liberal Democrats to give the appearance of being an "important and well-connected man", a court heard today.Michael Brown, who made a record £2.4m donation to the Liberal Democrats, is being tried in his absence for nine offences, including three of theft of $11,348,003 (£7m) from Charles Martin Edwards.Martin Edmund QC, prosecuting, said Brown induced Edwards initially to transfer $10m into an account on the premise that it was to fund trading in high value bonds on international markets. To reassure Edwards, the defendant handed over an official looking HSBC-headed document apparently restricting what happened to the cash, the jury at London's Southwark crown court heard. "But Mr Brown did not do as he claimed he would. It is the prosecution's case he simply never intended the funds would ever be used for the purpose of trading in bonds or, indeed, that the money would be safe in that account. He deceived Mr Edwards to get hold of his money … and then used that money as if it was his own," said Edmund.Three months after the money was paid into HSBC, the defendant transferred the entire $10m to an account held by a company called Refco, the court heard. Some $7.2m of that was then switched to a Euro account."Thereafter, Mr Brown went on what I shall describe as a spending spree," said Edmund. The prosecutor said some of the cash was paid to other investors as supposed profits from "pretend bond deals that never actually took place, and apparently to pay for Mr Brown's extravagant lifestyle, his business expenses and, apparently, donations".Edmund said Brown's donations to the Liberal Democrats "enabled him to create the impression that he was an important and well-connected man".When the fraud began to unravel, the Glasgow-born businessman used false documents to try to quell suspicion and finally sought to put "entirely inappropriate and criminal pressure" on investors not to contact the police, the jury heard. Brown, 42, of Hampstead, north London, denies committing a total of nine offences between February 9 2005 and April 17 2006.The trial continues.
