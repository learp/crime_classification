One of the country's most overcrowded jails is failing to protect prisoners from bullying and intimidation by staff as well as other inmates, an inspector's report says today.The report on Leeds prison says that inspectors heard too many staff referring to inmates as "bodies". It describes race relations at the jail as being at a low ebb, with more than half of black and ethnic minority prisoners saying that staff did not treat them with respect.Inspectors say that staff use excessive force, with even compliant prisoners routinely moved to the segregation unit under restraint and placed in special cells normally used for violent and disruptive inmates.The unit is described as being run in a militaristic fashion.Inspectors found that relationships between staff and prisoners were poor, with more than a third of inmates saying they felt unsafe. This figure rose to more than 40% in the case of black and ethnic minority inmates.Leeds holds 1,227 prisoners, more than 400 above its normal certified level. Anne Owers, the chief inspector, described the prison as exhibiting, in acute form, the problems associated with overcrowding.One wing is described as unfit for habitation and the report calls for its closure.The allegations of poor race relations at Leeds surface at a time when the jail has been under close scrutiny in that area. Last year, the prisons ombudsman held an inquiry after an Asian man was killed by his white cellmate, and the prison service investigated a dossier of complaints, mostly from black and ethnic-minority prisoners.No allegations against staff were proven, but the report says that prisoners speak of "undercover" racism at Leeds. It adds that all black and ethnic minority inmates surveyed said complaints of racist abuse were not dealt with fairly. Inspectors found that complaints were not followed up efficiently.In contrast, the resettlement strategy at Leeds comes in for high praise, along with the health and visitors' centres.Ms Owers said the inspection showed that it was difficult to sustain progress in an overcrowded, inner-city local prison where cultures were hard to change."Leeds prison exhibits, in acute form, some of the problems associated with our overcrowded prisons," she said.The governor of Leeds, Ian Blakeman, said that he was committed to reducing levels of force at the jail and that he was well aware of the race issues raised by the inspectorate."It is vital that all our staff demonstrate pro-social behaviour," he said.
