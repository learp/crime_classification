The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday June 25 2008The headline above misrepresented the results of a study by the Institute for Public Policy Research. The IPPR found that youth crime had not risen since 2002 but argued that government targets had made it more likely that young people would be criminalised for minor offences. An increasing number of young people are ending up in trouble with the police and the courts, according to figures released today. In some areas of England and Wales the number of under-18s passing through the criminal justice system has nearly doubled in the past six years.Figures gathered under the Freedom of Information Act by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank showed a 27% increase in the number of 10-18 year olds cautioned in England and Wales since 2002, and an 11% increase in convictions. The biggest increase in cautions was in Cheshire, where they increased by 95% in the same period. Hertfordshire registered the biggest rise in youth convictions, where there was 49% rise in 10-18 year olds being found guilty of a crime.The institute said the figures revealed a flaw in the government's criminal justice policy, which was criminalising young people who needed more help than punishment. Young criminals should be punished by a panel of victims and other community representatives rather than being sent to court for less severe offences, the IPPR said. Criminal courts could then focus on severe crimes.James Crabtree, associate director at the IPPR, said the government's system of targets "criminalises young people, increases reoffending and misdirects important resources away from dealing with severe offences and crime prevention".He added: "We should not be soft or tolerant, but the current trend of criminalisation is not working."The Ministry of Justice said: "Custody for under-18s is always used as a last resort. Only 3% of young people convicted by a court receive a custodial sentence."
