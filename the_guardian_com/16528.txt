The father of Dinah McNicol said today his family could at last "rest and grieve" after visiting the house where his daughter's remains were believed to have been hidden for 16 years.Ian McNicol stood in the muddy back garden where a body, believed to be that of the 18-year-old student, was found last Friday at the property in Margate, Kent.Four days earlier, the remains of the 15-year-old Scottish schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton were discovered at the same house. Both teenagers went missing in 1991.McNicol said the uncertainty surrounding the fate of his daughter had been a trying experience."But at least they have found her remains and I can speak for the whole family that we can now put her to rest and grieve in our own time which is what we have wanted for 16 years," he said.McNicol visited the site as forensic archaeologists continued their search for further human remains. Peter Tobin, 61, who on Thursday was charged with Vicky's murder, lived at the property in the early 1990s."We are focusing on the inside of the house now, using specialist dogs trained to assist us in detecting any type of activity which happened in that house," said an Essex police spokeswoman, Tabitha Wilson. "You will see that police have also been working in the front garden as well, which we are doing to ensure completeness of the investigation. That is being dug over, and the forensic archaeologists will take a look at it." Yesterday, police sources suggested other properties linked to Tobin were also likely to be searched soon.However, Steve Watts, the assistant chief of Hampshire police, said there was "no plan at this time to search any further premises"."These options will be considered should the intelligence and evidence developed within operation Anagram warrant it," he added. The lives of the two girls whose bodies were found last week were remembered in a special service at Margate's Holy Trinity church yesterday. Nicola Downing, who moved into the house with her family after Tobin left, said news that the remains had been discovered there was "devastating and unreal".
