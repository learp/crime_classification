West Midlands police yesterday handed back Â£2,500 seized from a mosque during a series of anti-terrorism raids earlier this month after confirming that it had been raised by the Muslim community for a building fund.The money was taken after the arrest of Usman Choudhary 23, the son of Dudley central mosque chairman Ghulam Choudhary, and Umar Ijaz, 24, both of Kates Hill in the town. The men later appeared before Halesowen magistrates' court charged with 12 offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2000 and were remanded in custody. The raids shocked Dudley's long-established Kashmiri community. The police had suspected the money came from credit card fraud and was intended to support terrorist activity. Yesterday Chief Superintendent Dennis Hodson said the inquiry into alleged terrorism was continuing, but that he was delighted the origins and purpose of the money were now known. Khurshid Ahmed, chairman of Dudley Muslim Association, said: "The Muslim community in Dudley totally opposes terrorism and we are deeply upset by suspicion that monies raised at the Mosque were seized as part of the police inquiry. We are delighted, but not surprised, the police have returned the money to us."
