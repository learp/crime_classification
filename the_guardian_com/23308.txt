Two former IRA prisoners tried to extort £300,000 from UK-based republican sympathisers with threats of violence, a London court heard yesterday.Nick Mullen, 60, previously charged with being the "quartermaster" of an IRA active service unit, and Ronald McCartney, 55, who was convicted of attempting to murder three policeman, tried to extort money from two businessmen who the court heard were Sinn Féin supporters.Southwark crown court was told that Mullen and McCartney, working with Louie O'Hara, 43, threatened the men after accusing them of using the name of the IRA to raise £6m for themselves. They warned the men that if they did not pay £150,000 each to the republican movement they would "face the consequences". All three deny two counts each of conspiracy to blackmail the businessmen, who cannot be named for legal reasons.Mullen, of Acton, west London, had been sentenced to 30 years in 1990 for conspiracy to cause explosions, the court heard. The conviction was later quashed on the grounds that the process used to return him from Zimbabwe was unlawful. McCartney, of west Belfast, had been convicted of IRA-related offences in 1976.Letters delivered to businessmen last year bore the Gaelic term for the IRA - Óglaigh na hÉireann - and were signed "P O'Neill", the name commonly used in Provisional IRA statements. After receiving the threats, the men called the police. Subsequent phone calls were recorded and will be played to the jury.The case continues.
