An 8% rise in robberies and an 11% increase in vandalism yesterday marred the latest quarterly crime figures, which showed an overall fall of 2% across all offences in England and Wales.The rise in street crime was accompanied by British Crime Survey indicators showing that public anxiety about teenagers on the streets, noisy neighbours, drug dealing, drunkenness and rowdiness has continued to increase despite the government's repeated campaigns against antisocial behaviour. Public confidence in the criminal justice system also fell, with fewer than one in three of those surveyed now believing it is effective at cutting crime, meeting the needs of victims or dealing with young offenders.But police recorded crime figures for the final three months of 2006 compared with 12 months earlier showed that violent crime generally was down by 1%, including a 16% fall in gun crime and an 11% fall in sex offences.The more authoritative British Crime Survey, which asks 40,000 people about their experience of crime each year, reported a broadly stable crime rate, including violent crime, during 2006. It showed that the risk of becoming a victim of crime remained historically low at 24%, compared with a peak of 40% recorded in 1995.The Home Office said yesterday that the 8% increase in robberies recorded by the police - up by 2,000 to 26,000 incidents in the final quarter of 2006 - had more to do with mobile phone and MP3 player thefts on the street than a revival in traditional cash-in-transit robberies. The 11% increase in vandalism recorded by the BCS and a 2% rise in criminal damage cases on the police figures underlined the increase in public anxiety on five out of seven indicators of antisocial behaviour.The policing minister, Tony McNulty, said mobile phones were involved in more than half of all street robberies and the government had set up regional robbery action plans to address a problem concentrated in specific areas. John Reid, the home secretary, told the cabinet yesterday he was opening talks with the industry about the next generation of mobile phones to ensure that anti-theft measures are incorporated into their design.Ian Johnston, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the rise in robberies was being tackled by deploying plainclothes officers with dedicated response vehicles in local hotspots. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, called for a single border police force to stop illegal drugs flowing into Britain, and for more police to be put on the streets.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said if endless government legislation and gimmicks could cut crime Britain would now be the safest country in the world.In numbers26,000: The number of incidents of robbery in England and Wales recorded by the police during the last quarter of 2006, up by 2,000 on the previous year24%: The risk of becoming a victim of crime as recorded in the British Crime Survey, which questioned 40,000 people
