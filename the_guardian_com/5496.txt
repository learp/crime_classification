A 48-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the theft of 3,000 blank passports and visas from a security van in Manchester, police said today. The documents, which were being taken to RAF Northolt for delivery to embassies abroad, were stolen when the van driver stopped to buy a chocolate bar and a newspaper at about 6.30 on Monday morning. The suspect, believed to be the delivery man who accompanied the driver, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery and is in police custody. Early reports said that during the robbery the delivery man remained inside the van where he was assaulted by two attackers and suffered minor injuries. The thieves hijacked the van, driving a short distance with the man still in the passenger seat, before running off with about 24 parcels.This morning a spokesman for Greater Manchester police said inquiries were ongoing and the missing passports and visas had not been recovered.The Identity and Passport Service said hi-tech embedded chip features meant the passports would be unusable. But security experts said they could be used for fraud and had a street value of about Â£2.5m. The Foreign Office said the theft was a serious breach of security but action had been taken to stop criminals using the documents.
