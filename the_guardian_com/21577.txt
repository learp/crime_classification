The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has been given over £27m to set up witness "care units" to encourage those involved in prosecutions to turn up at court, it emerged today.Last year, the failure of prosecution witnesses to turn up was the reason for 22% of adjournments in crown court trials and 26% at magistrates courts. The units will be staffed by police and the CPS, who will assess the needs of a witness - including childcare, transport, language difficulties, medical issues and the prospect of them facing intimidation.Dame Helen Reeves, the chief executive of the Victim Support charity, said: "We've long called for this type of service because witnesses must be treated with respect, provided with accurate information and not kept in the dark." However, she predicted a surge in demand for the charity's services, which they may be unable to meet due to a freeze on their funding by the Home Office.The new witness units award was included in a £46m package announced today by the Treasury and Cabinet Office, as part of the government's Invest to Save initiative. Other schemes to benefit include a plan to reduce the demand for specialist mental health services, an integration programme for asylum-seekers and a family conferencing plan to cut the number of children entering the criminal justice system. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Paul Boateng said: "[Invest to Save ] has helped develop new ways of working, for example partnerships between voluntary organisations and the public sector, as well as better outcomes such as more effective teaching of citizenship and reductions in crime and the fear of crime. "It has been a catalyst for change across the public sector and voluntary sector: sharing lessons learned and best practice across regions and departments and so helping to improve service delivery."It is expected that a total of around £370m will be spent on Invest to Save projects from April 1 1999 to March 31 2006. The scheme supports projects that work across different government departments and identifies new and more inexpensive ways of delivering services. Some of the new projects receiving funding include: · Capital Volunteering, which will be given over £7m to pair mental health service users with a volunteer as their social sponsor or "buddy" and connect them through a phone link· Peterborough Council, which will receive over £2m for a project designed to create an network of service providers, statutory agencies and support workers to help integrate new arrivals into Peterborough· Youth Justice Board, which will receive over £1.3m to develop family group conferencing to enhance the effectiveness of Youth Inclusion and Support Panels and so reduce the number of children entering the criminal justice systemInner London Detoxification Centre, which has been awarded over £1m to establish a centre as an alternative to police custody for homeless people with alcohol problems.
