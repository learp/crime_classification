John Reid and his EU counterparts were unable to reach agreement today on a prisoner transfer scheme that might help ease the overcrowding in Britain's jails, as the Home Office revealed that the prison system had room for just 125 more prisoners.According to the Associated Press news agency, justice ministers from Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland and Poland raised objections to an EU plan which would allow convicts sentenced in foreign EU nations to serve their sentences in their home countries.According to a Home Office spokesman, the prison population for England and Wales stood at 79,843 today, with a maximum capacity of just 79,968.Over 200 prisoners have been added to the total since last weekend, suggesting that full capacity could be reached within days.Home Office figures show that at the end of last year there were 1,998 prisoners from other EU countries in UK jails. The biggest group - 649 inmates - was from Ireland.The spokesman said today: "We are continuing to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity."And he confirmed that one option under consideration was to use cells at police stations to house prisoners, a strategy known as Operation Safeguard.Safeguard was last used in 2002 but officials are understood to be reluctant to have to resort to the measure if it can be avoided.In July, Mr Reid announced plans for 8,000 more prison places, of which around half would be provided by private security companies.But Paul Cavadino, chief executive of Nacro, the crime reduction charity, said today: "We cannot tackle this crisis simply by building more prisons."Unless we reverse this country's over-use of custodial sentences, courts will simply fill new prisons with ever more prisoners."He added: "We need a sustained government campaign to persuade courts and the public of the benefits of using prison more sparingly."Overcrowded prisons are less able to cut reoffending by rehabilitating prisoners."The possibility of transferring prisoners between EU countries was discussed today at the meeting in Luxembourg between the home secretary and his fellow justice and home affairs from other EU countries, but a final decision was not expected to be imminent.A spokeswoman for the Home Office told Guardian Unlimited that the agreement could take "a number of years" to introduce and was still at the draft stage, but that the UK was "keen to see agreement by December".She said a "useful disussion" had been held and pointed out that "the UK, along with the majority of member states, strongly supports this new instrument"."There's considerable political will to resolve the remaining concerns," she said.Sticking points for the dissenting EU countries today included the fact that the plan would not allow countries to refuse to take back unwanted prisoners.Questions were also raised about whether prisoners should have a right to refuse transfer."Everyone should go along with this [plan] as quickly as possible," the EU's justice and home affairs commissioner, Franco Frattini, told the EU ministers.Mr Frattini said that the plan, which has been debated for more than two years, provided for better rehabilitation of prisoners, allowing them closer access to friends and family, and other national and cultural links such as language.Finland's justice minister, Leena Luhtanen, whose country holds the EU presidency, said she aimed to get a final agreement by December.Speaking last night, the former Conservative prisons minister, Ann Widdecombe, said that surges in the prison population for England and Wales were not uncommon and outlined some of the contingency measures considered when she was in office."I brought in a prison ship from the United States. I bought Portakabins from Norwegian oil rigs and put them down in the lower-security prisons," she told BBC Radio 4's PM programme."At one point we were poised - we didn't actually do it - to take over a holiday camp."David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: "The way you get prison numbers down is by cutting the offending. Half of all our crime today is caused by convicts who reoffend."One of the reasons for that is our prisons have been allowed to get so crowded that we don't do any rehabilitation, we can't get them off drugs, we can't retrain and so the reoffending rates go up."An announcement of emergency measures for reducing Britain's prison overcrowding is expected in the next few days.
