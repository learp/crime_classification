A choirmaster jailed for six years for indecently assaulting a former pupil has lost a challenge against the length of his sentence.Michael Brewer, a former music director at Chetham's school of music in Manchester, was jailed in March after he was convicted of child sex offences against Frances Andrade, who killed herself after giving evidence during his trial.His appeal was rejected by the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, sitting with two other judges at the court of appeal in London. Brewer, 68, who claimed his sentence was excessive, was not present for the ruling.Judge described it as a "woeful case". Announcing the court's decision to dismiss the sentence appeal, he said: "There is nothing wrong with this sentence. It was an appropriate sentence for the offences committed by this applicant."It seems to us that he escaped justice for a very long time indeed and that justice has now caught up with him."Brewer, of Swarthmore Road, Selly Oak, Birmingham, was convicted at Manchester crown court of five counts of indecently assaulting Andrade when she was 14 and 15.The abuse took place in his office and in his camper van, which he used to drive her out of the school grounds and get her to perform oral sex on him.He was cleared of raping Andrade when she was 18 at his then home in Chorlton, Manchester.Judge said Brewer had been a man of "great distinction", who was "publicly honoured for his services to music".He was a man with "a rare talent for inspiring pupils with, and about, the joys of music and helping them to the fullest flowering of their musical abilities".The court had read "very many warm and affectionate" character references.But Judge said Brewer had committed a gross breach of trust, and clearly exploited the vulnerability of his victim.The sexual activity was of a very serious kind, which had a "devastating" effect on Andrade.Judge said: "It was clear from the evidence that her experience of what had happened to her while in the care of the applicant affected her and damaged her in very many ways, and she described how it coloured her view of men and indicated it had ruined her capacity for a normal, loving, sexual relationship."Brewer denied the offences, but the jury "accepted that the victim had given them a credible account of what had happened at the school and he was convicted".Judge said: "In his sentencing remarks, the judge of course expressed his deepest sympathy for the fact that the victim had died so tragically after giving evidence and before the conclusion of the trial â€“ so do we. But he had to address the offences with which the offender had been convicted."After the trial it emerged that Brewer had been stripped of the OBE awarded to him for services to music in December 1994.After he resigned as music director at Chetham's, he went on to become artistic director of the National Youth Choirs of Britain, to direct the World Youth Choir, serve as an adjudicator in international competitions and lead BBC workshops for the programme Last Choir Standing in 2008.Brewer's ex-wife Kay, 68, was jailed for 21 months after she was convicted at the same trial of indecently assaulting Andrade when she was 18.
