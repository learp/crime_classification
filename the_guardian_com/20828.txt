A thief who stole a pet owl was given a suspended nine-month sentence yesterday.Jason Dent, 23, made a desperate attempt to throw off a pursuing police car by hurling the angry bird out of his car window, but he and his accomplice were so shaken up that they crashed.Magistrates in Plymouth were told that the theft of Addy, a fully grown barn owl, went wrong from the start when the alarmed bird woke her owner and her cage proved too big to fit into the stolen car. "If he had left her alone they would probably have got away with it," said the owner, Paul Godbeer. "Owls can be grumpy and she soon started pecking at them."Denton told the court that the bird was "obviously distressed", so he let her go. She survived the drama with a dislocated leg and a haemorrhage in her right eye.Denton admitted burglary and aggravated vehicle taking. In addition to his sentence he was made subject of a curfew for six months between 7pm and 8am - the time when burglars burgle and owls fly.
