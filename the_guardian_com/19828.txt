As thousands gather for silent vigils against the recent terrorist murders in Northern Ireland a lively discussion has broken out on A Tangled Web over the power of today's protests.David Vance writes:"It's not that silent protests cannot be effective, it's just that I believe that the silent 'vigils' that have been organised by the Irish Congress of Trades Unions for this lunchtime are pointless. For starters, the killers and their support group in the republican community will not be listening. We do NOT need silence. There has been too much silence."Irish Barry replies:"If we don't show our faces today how else can we voice our protest? With angry words heaped upon angry words? I don't think so. Angry words are what got NI into the mess in the first place. Ian Paisley anyone?"Slugger O'Toole has set up a Twitter catcher for those tweeting from one of the gatherings.
