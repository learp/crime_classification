A Life Inside, the weekly prison diaries of Erwin James, have been an unmissable feature in the Guardian's G2 section over the last few years. To quote one enthralled reader: "Through your experiences, Erwin, I have learned a tremendous amount about the human spirit and our capacity to accept, learn and move forward". Now, after 20 years, Erwin has finally been released and is looking forward to a life outside. But, for one last time, he is prepared to look back at two institutionalised decades and will take part in a special Q&A session. In early September, Erwin will be online to answer your questions and talk about about life in prison, what's next for him and also the state of crime and punishment in this country. Email your questions to us at editor@societytheguardian.com, with Erwin James in the subject field, by September 3.
