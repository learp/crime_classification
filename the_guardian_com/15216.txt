Noisy neighbours and other antisocial tenants could have housing benefit withdrawn under proposals published today by the home secretary, David Blunkett.A white paper has warned that persistent bad behaviour could be an "automatic trigger" to stop benefits, while private landlords who fail to take action against problem tenants would lose housing benefit payments that currently go directly into their bank accounts. Mr Blunkett said the paper aims to tackle lawlessness in local communities: "We need a fundamental culture change in our society, where we take pride in our communities and challenge those who try to damage them."The wide-ranging paper, Respect and Responsibility - taking a stand against antisocial behaviour, said that youths as young as 16 would face fines of up to £80 if they cause a nuisance in local communities. Powers to hand out fixed penalty fines will also be extended beyond police and council officials. Organisations accredited by a chief constable, which are thought to include private security guards, will be able to issue fines for offences such as fly-posting and graffiti. The documents also said begging should lead to a criminal record for the first time. "It is not about waving a magic wand - it is about giving people the tools they need to claim back their communities for the decent law-abiding majority," Mr Blunkett said. Other main points of the paper include:· A new "intensive fostering" scheme for children whose parents have failed to bring them under control. · Parents of problem children will be asked by schools or local education authorities to sign a "parenting contract". Refusal to take part in activities to improve the young person's attendance or behaviour will lead to a fine, prosecution or a court-imposed Parenting Order· Councils will get powers to deal with noisy neighbours - first issuing a 10-minute warning, followed by a £100 fine and ultimately seizure of TV or stereo equipment which is causing the disturbance  · Environmental health officers will also be able to shut down immediately pubs or clubs causing a noise nuisance · Police will be able to - with the authority of a court - close a crack house with 48 hours notice and keep it sealed for up to six months to prevent dealers moving back in · It will be an offence to sell spray paints to under-18s and police will also get new powers to search for items that could be used to cause criminal damage· Local councils will now have to investigate fly-tipping and will get new powers to stop, search and seize vehicles being used by fly-tippers· Motorists using off-road vehicles in the countryside without permission will be banned from driving· Antisocial tenants will lose their secure or assured tenancies and also lose the right to buy their council property, in moves that will also make it easier to evict them if they do not improve their behaviour · Private landlords licensed to take social tenants will need to be "fit and proper persons" - in other words have no criminal convictions - or appoint agents who are, and will have to meet minimum management standards · Reporting restrictions on the media in cases of under-18s handed an Anti-Social Behaviour Order by the courts will be lifted so that offenders can be named and shamed, although exact details of the offence will remain confidential. The shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, said: "My suspicion is that we are going to see another set of flashy and unworkable initiatives from a government that specialises in headline-grabbing gimmicks and has no coherent strategy for tackling crime."
