The current record police force strength in England and Wales, which peaked at 141,000 officers, is "unsustainable" over the next three years and numbers are likely to fall, the government's most senior adviser on policing warned yesterday.Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief inspector of constabulary, said there was widespread recognition within the police that maintaining current numbers was not possible, and he predicted a "slight reduction" in the next three years.He said he hoped that politicians would recognise that reality rather than revert to an "unhelpful debate" over numbers which overshadowed the drive for reform."I am persuaded that we would not be making the most effective use of resources dedicated to the police if police officer numbers were sustained at their current level," said Flanagan. His reforms to cut bureaucracy and red tape as a result of his 12-month review into the future of policing are designed to save up to 7m hours of police time - the equivalent of an extra 3,500 officers a year being moved to frontline duties. He suggested there was room for civilian staff to take over fully-sworn officers' roles, including taking statements and some more "back office" functions.His proposals, widely trailed in a draft version this week, included changes to the way in which the police stop and question people on the streets.But he stopped short of recommending a particular option to address the "democratic deficit" felt by some communities over policing except to warn that the idea of elected police commissioners - advocated by the Tories - raised concerns that a single person with an elected mandate could too readily conflict with the operational judgment of the police.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, responded to the Flanagan report by adopting his proposals on stop and search. A short trial is to be held in the West Midlands and two other areas in which the form used in "stop and account" encounters is to be scrapped. Instead officers will radio back to the station a verbal record of the encounter and give those stopped a number to call for further information.
