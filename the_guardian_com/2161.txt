The government made a bid today to damp down street crime by launching a scheme that will render stolen mobile phone handsets useless.Under the Home Office scheme, victims of mobile phone theft will be able to shut down the phones with a single phone call to their network operator, in much the same way as cancelling a stolen credit card. By providing the phone's unique identifying code, or IMEI number, users can ask the network operator to list the handset on a central database of stolen phones. Anyone attempting to reconnect the stolen handset to a new network should find it impossible. The Home Office hopes the new database, introduced by all the UK mobile networks and the Global System for Mobiles Association, will reduce street crime figures by making phones worthless on the black market. "Home Office research shows that mobile phones are involved in 28% of robbery," said Home Office minister John Denham. "Our new legislation enables the police to take action against those fuelling the trade in mobile phones."The system applies to both pay-as-you-go and contract phones. The home secretary, David Blunkett, has already introduced a new law making re-programming the IMEI number punishable by up to five years in jail. Mr Denham added: "This is an important step and we will continue to work with the industry to keep pace with changing technology and one step ahead of the thieves." Jack Wraith, of the Mobile Industry Crime Action Forum, said: "With the dramatic increase in the number of mobile telephone users it is important that the customer can have the assurance that if their phone is stolen it will be worthless to the thief. The message to the thief is clear - this industry will not condone criminal activity."The Home Office advises mobile phone owners to register their phone with their network operator to make barring easier. They should also make a note of their IMEI number and keep it in a safe place separate from their phone. IMEI numbers can be accessed by keying £06£ into most phones or by looking behind the battery.
