Two bank workers stole more than £350,000 from the accounts of former Premiership footballers, who had no idea their money had gone missing, a court heard yesterday.Paul Sherwood, 26, and Paul Hanley, 20, employees of the Co-operative Bank in Manchester city centre, diverted funds from the accounts of former Manchester City players Djamel Belmadi, Daniel Van Buyten and Vincente Vuoso shortly after the players had left the club and the UK. Manchester crown court heard how Sherwood, a cashier, recruited his supervisor, Hanley, and two other men to help steal and launder the money.Steven Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the court: "Manchester City have a basic arrangement with the Co-op Bank. Footballers who sign for the club have an account with that bank. Wages are paid into the accounts, but footballers would not use it on a day-to-day basis."The cash was stolen between December 2002 and February 2005 from accounts left open by the players. Sherwood stole £238,035 in sums ranging from £100 to £9,000. Hanley stole £70,740 from two accounts and was responsible for one withdrawal of approximately £60,000.Hanley recruited his flatmate Lewis Chadwick, 21, and more than £60,000 was laundered through Chadwick's account, for which he was paid £14,000. Zac Smith, 21, also had money passed through his account, for which he received £460. Sherwood gambled most of the money away. Hanley and Chadwick rented apartments in Manchester city centre and enjoyed five-star holidays to South America.In February 2005 the bank identified financial irregularities on the accounts. The thefts were linked to Sherwood and Hanley. Both men were suspended and later dismissed. Yesterday they admitted multiple theft charges.Judge Martin Steiger QC told Sherwood and Hanley they had committed a "gross breach of trust". Sherwood was sentenced to 32 months in prison. Hanley will serve 12 months in a young offenders institution. Chadwick and Smith were given 200-hour community punishment orders.
