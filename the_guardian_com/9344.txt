The prisons chief, Martin Narey, was yesterday banned from making a speech in which he had been expected to tell prison officers that it was time to be more polite to inmates and call them by their first names, or if they preferred, Mr, Madam, Ms or Miss.The decision that Mr Narey should not address the annual conference of the Prison Officers' Association yesterday was made by John Gieve, the Home Office's permanent secretary, who ruled he was in danger of breaching civil service rules on impartiality during a general election. The prison service would not confirm the issue of how prison officers addressed inmates was part of the draft Mr Narey submitted for approval to the head of the Home Office but it had been widely trailed that he was going to raise the issue. Mr Narey is the most senior Whitehall figure to have been caught by the civil service "purdah" rules which ban the announcement of controversial policy developments. A prison service spokeswoman insisted that Mr Narey was not announcing official new policy and had only been speaking "off the cuff" when he told the Observer he wanted to see prison officers talk to inmates with dignity and to treat them as they would their own sons and daughters. "It is not a policy. He was expressing an aspiration ... There is no guidance or instructions to governors about it," she said. The director general had been expected to talk about the progress that had been made in industrial relations within the prison service with a new no-strike and compulsory arbitration procedure, and the substantial improvements inside the worst of the country's prisons.
