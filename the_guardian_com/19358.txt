The Green party will today make crime a centrepiece of their last conference before a likely general election, in a break from their usual focus on climate change, genetically modified food and conflict.Although the radical environmentalist party, meeting in Weston-super-Mare for the final conference of the autumn season, will still debate the topics they have traditionally made their own over their 30-year history.But, with a general election widely expected for May 5 next year, the party is now pitching at a more mainstream audience - albeit with a far from mainstream message.The Greens, who now have two members on the London assembly, two MEPs in Brussels, over 50 local councillors, and seven MSPs in Edinburgh, will be calling for more rehabilitation in prisons, and more police patrols on push-bikes.Party spokesman Spencer Fitzgibbon said: "Other parties stir up the fear of crime for their own rightwing agendas. We are going to be tough on crime, not just tough on the offender."Prisons have become schools for offenders - we want to see proper rehabilitation, even if it's more expensive in the short term, because that is what actually reduces crime."And putting police officers on bikes has been shown to reduce crime, and bring the police closer to the community they serve - and give them access to estates and back alleys where so much crime occurs."The four-day event at the Winter Gardens will also see the debut "leader's speech" by new principal speaker Keith Taylor.Mr Taylor, who scored the Greens' highest vote of 9% in the Brighton Pavillion constituency at the last general election, took over as male principal speaker (the party has no official leader) after the death of Mike Woodin from cancer earlier this year.Woodin, a lecturer at Balliol college, Oxford, Green councillor and father of two, gave an emotional farewell address to colleagues at the party's spring conference in Hove earlier this year, and died aged just 38 shortly afterwards.The party will be holding a memorial for him, after Mr Taylor addresses activists on the theme of "revalue your vote".He will say: "Iraq, trust and disillusionment are the key feelings about this government, and it's easy to feel apathetic with the whole setup, but I will call on people to revalue their vote, that it is precious and it is worth voting Green."On Friday, new party member and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell will call for a "second Chartist movement" to get a fair voting system for the House of Commons. He compares current first past the post system with the 19th century "rotten boroughs".Mr Tatchell will say: "A second chartist movement is needed to remedy the corruption of the first past the post system whereby Labour wins a majority of 167 MPs at the last election despite only securing 46% of the votes and the backing of only 24% of eligible electors."I want to see an alternative modelled on the system for Scotland and London elections which preserve the constituency based MPs but ensure some degree of proportionality" he will say.Other guests at the conference include Tony Juniper of Friends of the Earth and Dan Plesch of the Impeach Blair campaign.Angered by recent speeches by both Tony Blair and Michael Howard on climate change, the party will also "throw down the gauntlet" to the mainstream parties to endorse policies that they say will actually avert "impending climate catastrophe".There are also debates on mobile phone masts, and a call for the Welsh assembly to follow the Scottish parliament in supporting breastfeeding in public.
