A police officer is to face disciplinary charges over an allegedly brutal arrest which was blamed for sparking off one of last year's summer riots in the north.West Yorkshire police have accepted a recommendation from the police complaints authority that the constable be charged with abusing his authority in a confrontation with a disabled Asian motorist. Rumours about the incident, in which 32-year-old Hussein Miah claimed he was handcuffed, dragged from his car and sprayed with CS gas, led to an angry crowd gathering outside Chapeltown police station in Leeds in June last year. They were calmed by senior officers and local Labour MP Fabian Hamilton, but two nights later, youths went on the rampage in the area, burning cars, shops and a launderette and injuring 23 police officers. The crown prosecution service held an inquiry into the Miah incident but decided in May that charges against the officer would not stand up in court. The PCA said yesterday that its own 16 month inquiry had concluded that the constable should face a misconduct hearing, which will be held in private in front of an assistant chief constable and two superintendents from the West Yorkshire force. Mr Miah said he was pleased that action was being taken "at last" over "a horrible ordeal which has caused a terrible strain in the lives of all my family".
