Government drug advisers are expected to recommend a ban today on a new generation of legal highs that have been marketed as substitutes for mephedrone or "meow meow", which was banned in April.The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) is due to report to the home secretary, Theresa May, on the new group of legal highs, marketed as a "research plant food" NRG-1 and advertised with a chemical name of naphyrone.But in a letter to the British Medical Journal published today a group of chemists and criminologists says that most of these NRG-type products are mephedrone being marketed under a new label.The experts from Liverpool John Moores university based their disclosure on tests of 17 products bought online from 12 UK-based websites over the six weeks after the ban on mephedrone came into effect.The BMJ letter says that NRG-1 is one of the most prominently discussed second-generation products which have been offered as legal substitutes for mephedrone and five other related pschoactive cathinone compounds which essentially imitate the effects of amphetamines."Most of the NRG-type products were recently banned cathinones that just carried a new label; this suggests that both consumers and online sellers are, most likely without knowledge, at risk of criminalisation and potential harm," says the letter signed by Simon Brandt, a senior lecturer in analytical chemistry and three others including criminologist, Fiona Measham, who was a co-author of the ACMD report recommending the original ban on mephedrone. "This has important health and criminal justice consequences."They argue that their findings should be of concern to potential consumers who may believe that legal highs are of a higher purity than street drugs, carry fewer risks of physical harm and do not involve criminal penalties.The ACMD inquiry into NRG-1 was initiated by the government in the wake of the ban on mephedrone. The original technical description of this group of compounds, synthetic designer drugs, is the "naphyl analogue of pyrovalerone". Pyrovalerone is already a banned class C drug in Britain. It is widely prescribed as an appetite suppressant.NRG-1 is being sold on British websites as the latest in "research plant food" which is not fit for human consumption but which "your plants will enjoy trying out". Mephedrone was advertised in a similar way but the ACMD report noted it was useless as a plant food.
