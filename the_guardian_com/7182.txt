A pub landlady has been sent an apology from a woman involved in a burglary at the pub more than 20 years before. Frances Cunningham, of the Swettenham Arms in Cheshire, said she was astonished to receive the note, which was accompanied by a cheque for Â£100 to cover any damages that the theft may have caused. The letter concluded: "I am so ashamed and sad because of the fear it may have induced and the cost and time. I wish I could take it back a lot, I hope that you will never be bothered by such cruelty ever again."Cunningham has said she intends to write to the sender, assuring her that she has been forgiven.Is there anything you would like to get off your chest and confess to?
