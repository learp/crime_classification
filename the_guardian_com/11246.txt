Judges are fighting moves to abolish the QC system, claiming it is a vital safeguard against pressure on barristers to "bend the rules" in order to win cases.The lord chancellor announces new batches of Queen's counsel, or "silks", each Easter. They are the elite cadre of senior barristers, recognised as the leaders of their profession and entitled to charge higher fees.Last month, Lord Irvine announced that the selection round for next year's batch of QCs would be suspended pending the outcome of a consultation exercise to decide whether the rank should be abolished. The Office of Fair Trading has branded it a restrictive practice and said it should go unless it could be shown to operate in the public interest.Lord Irvine told the 121 new "silks" who were sworn in at the end of April that there was "an appetite for change" and that they could be the last to win the rank. If an award were to be retained for top barristers, he questioned whether the state should continue to grant it.A Bar Council working party chaired by a retired appeal court judge, Sir Iain Glidewell, has proposed that QCs should be selected by an independent panel chaired by a retired senior judge.But in a resounding defence, the judges have told the lord chancellor the system should stay just as it is and his part in it should remain unchanged.A working party representing the judiciary from top to bottom, excluding only the 12 law lords, said the QC system was not simply a quality mark but "an important part of the machinery of justice".The party's defence of the 400-year-old system was in response to a consultation paper from the lord chancellor on whether public interest justifications existed for practices in the legal profession, including the silk system, that were viewed as anti-competitive by the OFT.The judges say the QC system plays a useful part in identifying future candidates for the bench, and identifies "a body of advocates who are the leaders in their profession, not only as being excellent lawyers and advocates but, above all, as having complete integrity".They add: "Those who wish to be a QC have to show that they have reached those high standards. The temptation to 'bend the rules', given the pressure to win from clients and solicitors, is never far away. The conferment of silk by the lord chancellor, who is independent of the bar and of the solicitors' profession, is an endorsement of the qualities and integrity of the recipient, and as such an important assurance to the public and courts."The judges also endorse the silk selection system, which has been criticised by the lord chancellor's own independent watchdog on judicial and QC appointments, Sir Colin Campbell, for being too opaque and lacking a clear "audit trail".They comment: "We believe that the process of consultation, assessment and ultimate appointment that currently operates is as wide-ranging and thorough as is practically achievable, and that, over time, candidates who merit silk are able to achieve that rank."
