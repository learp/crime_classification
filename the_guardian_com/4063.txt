Jason Lucas, 23, hit a man in a Manchester club, admitted causing actual bodily harm and was given two years probation at Manchester crown court. The judge recommended he should attend an anger management course run by the Greater Manchester probation service, which he has almost completed."I was drunk and I didn't like what this person had to say to me. I suppose I took advantage of the situation and was showing off. I picked a fight and I was arrested. I didn't use a bottle or anything. I was sorry for my action because I'm not usually that type. He was trying to defend himself and apologise at the same time. And that's the way I've learned to look at things now - I try to walk away from a situation rather than confront it. My personality has changed and I have a lot more control. I feel sorry for what I did, of course I do. At court, the charges were reduced when it was found that some of his injuries were caused when he fell. The judge was really sympathetic to me and listened to my full story, seeing what had been going on in my life through drinking. He gave me a second chance. I've been in trouble before. The drinking was making me that kind of person but I didn't find that till I went on the anger management course. I've been going once a week. We are in groups of not less than four and talk to counsellors about our problems and what's going through our minds. They make us realise what we have been taking for granted and what we have to lose. I found it difficult at first but the teachers make you feel easier. It's given me confidence, helped me go for things. I'm at Stockport College now, doing an IT course and a website design course. I'm doing really well. I owe the course a lot. My attitude has changed. I've a lot more confidence in myself. I want to keep out of trouble now because we've just had a baby daughter."
