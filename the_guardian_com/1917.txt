Prosecutors in date rape cases will be freed to call expert witnesses on the trauma of sex crimes to shatter juries' misconceptions about the crime, under plans to boost convictions to be unveiled this week.Victims who delay reporting the alleged attack or appear unusually composed in the witness box should no longer be treated with suspicion, the consultation paper from the solicitor general Mike O'Brien will argue.The witnesses could describe how a traumatised victim might require time to raise the courage to go to police, why she might have stayed with an abusive partner - factors that might lead a jury to doubt her story - or the ways in which she might respond to giving evidence.The law on consent will also be clarified to protect women who are too drunk to be capable of consenting to sex, putting the onus back on the defence to prove that a woman who was incapable through alcohol was actually a willing partner. Video testimony from women's interviews with police in the immediate aftermath of a rape, when they are likely to have been most distressed, could also be permitted in courts.The changes will affect all rape cases but will be most relevant to so-called 'date rapes' where the attacker was known to the victim - and where juries have proved more reluctant to convict than rapes committed by strangers.'Rape is an appalling crime that devastates the lives of victims and their families. The conviction rate is too low and we need to do something about it,' said a source close to the solicitor general.The consultation paper forms part of a concerted effort by ministers this week to show they take violence against women seriously, after damaging leaks of plans by the independent Sentencing Advisory Council to reduce rape sentences. Junior Home Office minister Fiona MacTaggart will announce plans to protect prostitutes from violent clients, while her colleague Baroness Scotland will unveil plans for advisers to help victims of domestic and sexual violence through court.Only one in 20 rape allegations ends in a guilty verdict. Acquaintance rapes are the most common, but most difficult to prosecute, while even in stranger rape cases, perceptions of the victim have proved crucial to the trial and sentencing.The expert witnesses would not testify specifically about the victim's mental state but would present general evidence on the psychology of sex-attack victims. They could also tackle common assumptions such as that a scantily clad woman must have been 'asking for it' or to blame.The paper will also call for either a change in the law or new guidance for judges on cases where the victim is drunk or high on drugs.
