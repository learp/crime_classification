A man has admitted carrying out what police called a “callous and sickening” robbery, knocking down a 92-year-old man for just £5.Soloman Bygraves followed Stanley Evans into his block of flats and pushed him over as he lunged for his wallet.Evans remained on the ground in the entrance to the flats in Soho, central London, for five minutes. He eventually managed to get to his feet and take the lift to his flat to call 999.The pensioner suffered a shoulder injury in the incident at around 8pm on 31 January, but did not require hospital treatment.Bygraves, 29, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty at London’s Southwark crown court via videolink from Wandsworth prison. Wearing a grey tracksuit, he spoke only to confirm his name and plead guilty.Evans, who is now 93, said he felt he had been regarded as an “easy touch”. He told ITV News: “I wasn’t scared, no. If I was fitter I would have gone out after him.“I know he was desperate for money, to get drugs or something, or he might have thought: ‘Oh, it’s an easy touch here, he can’t touch me even if he wants to’.”Helen Thomas, prosecuting, said: “This case involves the robbery of a 92-year-old man who was returning to his home address after a shopping trip and was set upon by the defendant in the lobby area of his block of flats.“There are fairly lengthy antecedents. There is also CCTV footage covering the incident. It is my view your lordship would wish to see this prior to sentencing.”John Causer, defending, said Bygraves had a lengthy criminal record, including three convictions for robbery. He said: “The court will wish to consider the issue of dangerousness. There is a background of mental health issues and drug issues.”Judge Alistair McCreath remanded Bygraves in custody to be sentenced on 13 April. He also ordered pre-sentence reports.
