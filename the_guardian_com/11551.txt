An armed gang of would-be kidnappers were caught red-handed outside their intended victim's house with hand-written instructions on how to carry out the snatch, a court heard today.Apart from a list of "to do's" about "acquiring cash" and a "deposit in unknown account", it also included the various threats to be used, it was claimed.The unlikely aide-de-memoire began with the word "blindfold" and then went on: "Ask him 'Are you Mr David Bodman?" - the name of their intended victim and once a "wealthy benefactor" to alleged gang member Carl Wiltshire and his family.The list of prompts even suggested his likely answer: "Yes".Richard Milne, prosecuting, said the notebook narrative continued: "You had better come with us whether you like it or not. We are not going to hurt you but we will if we have to. We have been following you. We know where you work, where your close family and friends live."A reference to the would-be victim's niece followed, with a warning she would be "hurt...if you don't do what we want"."If you go to the police we will know and the people we work for will come after you and your family."Afterwards there was another question: "What means more to you? You and your family's lives or losing out on some money?"Counsel said: "This is the plan, set out page by page, item by item. It was the complete plan of what they were proposing to do...You may think it was a very important document - evidence of a conspiracy to kidnap and blackmail."London's Southwark crown court heard in addition to the notebook found on alleged gang member Daniel Joseph, he had a realistic-looking gun-shaped cigarette lighter under his armpit, as well as a rucksack containing all the "tools" needed for the planned midnight abduction.It included water bottles containing de-icer and paint stripper which the barrister said may have been sprayed into Mr Bodman's eyes or used on some cloth clamped over his mouth and nose to make him "dizzy and drowsy".In addition there was a Scream mask, two other masks, a roll of duct tape, a small hammer, a couple of glass cutters, and a length of material "which you, members of the jury, may think was to be put round Mr Bodman's head once he had been bound up".In the dock are Wiltshire, 21, of Springfield Road, St Albans, Hertfordshire; Daniel Joseph, 18, of Golden Manor Drive, Golders Green, and Pierre Joseph, 20, unrelated, of Maxey Gardens, Dagenham, Essex.They all deny conspiring to kidnap and blackmail Mr Bodman on December 15 last year. They also plead not guilty to two counts of possessing a "silver imitation firearm" with intent to commit those offences.The trial continues.
