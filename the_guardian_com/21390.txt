A neighbouring police force has been called in to investigate allegations of child abuse against the chairman of Humberside police authority who earlier this year defied the home secretary over the Soham murders inquiry.Detectives from the North Yorkshire force have been asked to look at claims against Colin Inglis, who is also leader of Hull city council.Mr Inglis, hit the headlines earlier this summer when his police authority refused to comply with an order from David Blunkett to suspend Humberside's chief constable, David Westwood, following criticisms of the force in the Bichard report into the deaths of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.Last week, a man went to police with allegations about Mr Inglis relating to when he was a social worker at a Hull children's home in the 1980s.The politician has strenuously denied the allegations. Humberside police investigated similar allegations against Mr Inglis in 1997 but prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to take the matter further. In a statement the force said: "Humberside police will now confirm that it has asked North Yorkshire police to investigate an allegation of historic child abuse."Mr Inglis said yesterday: "My understanding is that North Yorkshire police has been given a narrow and well defined brief to determine whether the individual making recent allegations is saying anything different to comments he made in the 1990s."The child abuse victims' support group, Phoenix Survivors, which is supporting the man making the allegations, today confirmed he had met senior North Yorkshire officers.It called for Mr Inglis to be suspended. A spokeswoman for the organisation said: "We at Phoenix feel that given that North Yorkshire police have now confirmed they are investigating these allegations Mr Inglis should now be suspended with immediate effect."
