Three gang members were jailed yesterday for terms of up to seven years for helping Sean Mercer evade justice after he shot and killed 11-year-old Rhys Jones as the boy walked home from football practice. Rhys died after a single shot to the neck as he crossed a car park in Croxteth Park, Liverpool, in August 2007.Yesterday at Liverpool crown court James Yates, 20, who provided the Smith and Wesson handgun, was sentenced to seven years for possessing a weapon, and two five-year sentences, to run concurrently, for assisting an offender.Dean Kelly, 17, was sentenced to four years for assisting an offender, and Nathan Quinn, 18, was sentenced to two years in addition to the five years he is already serving for separate gun-related offences. The judge said they would not serve the full sentences because of time served on remand. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was given a two-year supervision order with a curfew that will last four months.At the trial in December the court heard that Mercer fled the scene on a pushbike and arrived at the home of the 16-year-old, where a cover-up plan was hatched, including burning Mercer's clothes. Detectives placed listening devices in the homes of the 16-year-old and others, which revealed attempts by the defendants and others to press witnesses to alter their stories. Mercer was convicted last month of murder and sentenced to 22 years. He is appealing against the sentence.
