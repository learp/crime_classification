More than 100 foreign prisoners have been removed from an open prison on the south coast after the escape of 11 foreign inmates in the past fortnight.The 141 foreign detainees in Ford open prison, a 540-bed facility near Arundel, West Sussex, have been moved temporarily to higher-security facilities while their positions are assessed.It was revealed last week that convicted drug mule Ransford James Baker walked out of the prison this month, halfway through a six-and-a-half year term.The judge in his 2003 trial had recommended he be deported back to his native Jamaica at the end of his sentence.The shadow prisons minister, Nick Herbert, whose Arundel and South Downs constituency contains Ford, accused the government of trying to cover up the scandal."It seems extraordinary that prisoners awaiting deportation, or who are likely to be deported, should be held in an open prison at all when they have little incentive to remain in custody," he said. "Public confidence in the penal system is severely undermined by this kind of mismanagement."A Home Office spokesman said senior prison service managers had been monitoring the situation for the past week."The prisoners are all being returned to closed conditions where they will be fully and rigorously risk-assessed before any decision is made on the level of security they require," he said.Only category D prisoners are in the lowest risk category and can be held in open prisons.The escapes came in the wake of the foreign prisoner deportation scandal that cost the former home secretary Charles Clarke his job earlier this month.Control of the foreign prisoners issue is fast becoming a poisoned chalice in Whitehall. Mr Clarke's successor John Reid admitted to parliament yesterday that he had given incorrect figures on foreign prisoners to a Commons home affairs select committee at which he said his department was "not fit" to handle its tasks.According to a statement from Mr Reid on Monday, of 1,019 foreign prisoners who should have been considered for deportation, a decision had been made in 778 cases, although only 37 people had been removed.Prison Reform Trust spokesman Will Higham said that the escapes from Ford may well have been provoked by the fact that foreign prisoners now expect to be deported, whereas previously they would have stood a better chance of being released into the community."You are probably going to provoke more escapes with these sorts of strong-arm tactics," he said. "Most of these prisoners are first-time offenders who've been working as drugs mules from the Caribbean. They're not hardened criminals."He said that a significant number were also EU nationals, who cannot be deported under EU rules unless they are considered a threat to national security.Foreign prisoners make up 13% of the UK prison population, numbering 10,265 among a total population of 76,678.Around a fifth of that number are EU nationals, and half of convicted foreign prisoners are inside for drugs offences.Before the recent events, 409 foreign prisoners were held in open prisons, including the 141 who have been moved from Ford and the 11 who absconded. In Ford they made up nearly a third of the prisoners.
