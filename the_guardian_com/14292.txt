Journalists and photographers came under attack on Monday as London faced its third consecutive day of violent riots in the capital.Mark Stone, the Sky News reporter, was lauded for his bravery on Monday night after he left his home near Clapham Junction to record looting on his iPhone.Stone, who recently returned from reporting the conflict in Libya, memorably accosted looters and asked: "Are you proud of what you're doing?" One young woman responded that she was "just getting my taxes back".Shortly afterwards he was chased by rioters and forced to flee, but returned to report live to camera on the aftermath of the Clapham Junction disturbance after Sky News dispatched a satellite truck, entering a looted Boots store and fetching an empty packet of Imodium from the litter-strewn floor.Reporters from the BBC and Sky News were forced to retreat from London Road in Croydon, after their vehicles had their windows smashed by rioters.CNN reporter Dan Rivers, kitted out in a helmet and what looked like body armour under his jumper, and his cameraman were caught between rioters and a police line in Peckham. They beat a hasty retreat as bottles and other missiles began to rain down.ITN, the producer of ITV News, Channel 4 News and London Tonight, had its broadcasting van attacked shortly after a peace vigil held by community leaders in Tottenham earlier in the evening. Kris Jepson, the Channel 4 News reporter, said on Twitter that a cameraman's equipment had been smashed in the scuffle.Mark Evans, the home news editor at Sky News, praised Stone's commitment – and pointed out that he was not technically on duty. He said the broadcaster's correspondents were given a special security briefing on Tuesday morning.BBC News journalists are understood to be receiving a similar briefing later in the day, in preparation for a fourth night of unrest in the capital."Mark's a very committed and brave young journalist," Evans told MediaGuardian.co.uk. "His use of kit shows how technically minded both he and Sky News are. We don't have the same kind of kit and resources that our competitors do and the use of iPhones and other tools allows us to be first."Sky News had about eight reporters and eight cameramen covering the unrest in London and Birmingham on Monday night.The BBC and ITN declined to say how many reporters they had on the ground, although off-duty journalists were phoning in reports from across London for all the broadcasters.An ITN spokesman said: "We are monitoring the situation closely and are only deploying staff who are trained and experienced in reporting in such circumstances."The BBC and Sky News are understood to have used hired private security guards to accompany their cameramen for the past two nights, after they attracted hostility on Saturday. Both those broadcasters pulled out their TV crews from Tottenham at 1am on Sunday morning, after the first wave of violent protests earlier on Saturday evening.BBC1 ditched regular programming on Tuesday morning to provide live coverage of David Cameron's announcement that he was recalling parliament in response to the disorder, and Channel 4 News aired a special midday bulletin.Riots drive viewers to news channelsViewers hungry for news of the London riots on Monday provided Sky News with its biggest audience since the Iraq war a decade ago, while the BBC News channel claimed its highest-ever viewing figures.BSkyB said Sky News had a reach of 6.81 million viewers for its coverage on Monday, its biggest daily audience figure since 7.3 million that tuned in to watch Iraq war coverage in 2003.
