An undergraduate security guard who was left fighting for his life after being shot by a notorious gangster he had evicted from a student union event has described the attack as "vicious" and "degrading".Aaron Waller, now aged 22, was shot three times in March 2007 by Jermain Carty, a member of Birmingham gang the Johnson Crew, after he threw him out of Loughborough University's students' union.The business studies student, a promising rugby star, has only just returned to his studies after spending a year recovering from his horrific injuries.Carty was jailed for 14 years after he was found guilty at Leicester Crown Court of attempted murder and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.In a victim impact statement Waller made three months after the attack, he said: "I have no desire to talk about the attack; it was vicious, unbelievably painful and degrading and my family and friends realise this."I realise that my scars will be with me for my lifetime and dread the attention they will bring when I am fit enough to swim or enjoy a beach holiday."I have to live with what happened to me on that night and the truth is, it was a pointless attack on me by a person I had done no harm to and I now consider myself lucky to be alive."He added: "My outlook on life has completely changed because I have lost my mental and physical strengths at this time and I am concerned how I will cope with the future. At this time, with regards to the man who did this to me, all I feel is anger at what he did and what he has taken from me."During the trial, the jury heard how Waller had helped to throw an "abusive" and "threatening" Carty out of the students' union, where American R&B group Pretty Ricky were playing in the early hours of March 11 last year.But during the scuffle, Carty had broken a gold chain. Angered by security staff, he returned to the students' union armed with a Glock 9mm handgun. He then shot Waller, who was 21 at the time, once in the chest and twice in the leg.In the statement, Mr Waller described his fear at having been shot. He said: "Whilst being away from home I have found that I am an independent person who not only survives but also enjoys and succeeds through that independence."However, all this changed from the moment I found myself lying on the floor having been shot, then struggling to take in a single breath in the ambulance with the thought that I was going to die."My thoughts then were that I may not see my family again or my girlfriend and that I would not even be able to say goodbye to them. I found this hard to deal with."The court heard today that Carty had a string of convictions for robbery, possessing a gun and drug dealing.Jailing Carty for a minimum of 14 years, judge Michael Pert QC said: "I have formed the view that you are an arrogant young man who was determined not to let a slight on your person go unpunished."You took deliberate aim and fired repeatedly at university security staff who were only students. You hit one of them three times and it was only a matter of chance that he didn't die."After the verdict detective chief inspector Phil Taylor said: "Carty's choice to become involved in guns and crime makes him a dangerous man and we are pleased with today's verdict. I can only hope that the fact Carty has faced justice in respect of this incident will allow all those involved, but particularly Aaron Waller, to move on with their lives."In a joint statement on behalf of Loughborough University and students' union, the vice-chancellor Prof Shirley Pearce said: "As a small, close-knit community, the incident last year shocked us all at the university and union. It was an unprecedented event on campus."We are pleased that it has now been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The student injured in the incident has thankfully made a full recovery and due to his determination and resilience, he remains on course to complete his degree on schedule."
