A target list of the 1,000 most wanted organised gangs operating in Britain has been drawn up by a new FBI-style crime fighting agency.Launching the Serious and Organised Crime Agency - Soca - the prime minister said the organisation would "make life hell" for the country's most sophisticated and brutal criminals."We are not dealing with shambling amateurs. It is a global business, its captains are practical and we have to be equally tough, intelligent, broad-ranging and rigorous in return," said Mr Blair.Some of the criminal cartels Soca is up against are bigger than the 4,200-strong agency itself, said Sir Stephen Lander, the Soca chairman. The agency will be the first in the country to combine the powers of police, customs and immigration officers.But staff will have no special powers over and above what is available to other law enforcement agencies, and Soca's director, Bill Hughes, previously head of the National Crime Squad, said only the most urgent of operations would take place without the knowledge and usually the involvement of local police.Mr Blair highlighted recent legislation in four areas which he said would help Soca's work. They are formalised supergrass deals, disclosure notices to make suspects answer questions, enhanced criminal asset confiscation laws and financial reporting orders to enable courts to check on possible criminal earnings.Mr Blair pledged to monitor Soca's progress and introduce more powers if necessary. "I want to make it quite clear that if, on the basis of the work we now do, we find we need to go further, we will go further," he said. "There is absolutely nothing, in my view, that should come before the basic liberties of people in this country to be freed from the tyranny of this type of organised crime."The Soca annual plan, published yesterday, said the agency would devote 40% of its operational effort on drug trafficking, 25% on people trafficking, 10% on fraud, including emerging trends in e-crime, and 15% on other organised crime.Organised crime is estimated to cost the UK more than £20bn - or £300 a person - every year. According to the Home Office, the main crime bosses based in Britain are worth of about £440m, roughly equal to Soca's £400m annual budget.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, gave examples of human trafficking and drug smuggling networks which involved huge numbers of footsoldiers and dozens of countries. "We shouldn't underestimate the scale of what we have to do," he said. "We have to attack these organisations in a complex, systematic, targeted and focused way."Sir Stephen, a former MI5 chief, said his staff had spent the past 18 months analysing intelligence on criminal gangs so they could target them accurately. "It is a sizeable number. Some of these organisations deploy very considerable numbers and have very considerable wealth. We have to be more ambitious."Soca will have up to 140 staff based in around 40 countries worldwide, many embedded in foreign agencies, like the US FBI and Drugs Enforcement Agency, which will have a reciprocal arrangement with Soca to enable quick and efficient intelligence-sharing.Sir Stephen admitted that the formation of Soca had been "quite a bumpy time" because of the merger of several culturally different law enforcement agencies - the former National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Service, the investigative wings of customs and immigration, and civilian experts.Mr Clarke said plans to restructure 43 English and Welsh police forces into less than half that number would complement Soca's work.The plans followed a constabulary inspectorate report which identified significant weaknesses in tackling organised crime and it was for this very reason the mergers must go ahead as soon as possible, he added.
