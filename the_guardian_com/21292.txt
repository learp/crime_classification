A rapist who needed a retrial in an earlier rape case when the judge fell asleep was yesterday jailed after his conviction for an assault on an 18-year-old woman.Lee Woodward was cleared of raping a 17-year-old girl in 2001 after his defence team complained that Judge Gabriel Hutton had dozed off twice when he should have been listening. The proceedings were abandoned and the judge was reprimanded for his behaviour. Woodward was later cleared after a retrial.Two years later he was again charged with raping an 18-year-old woman in Stroud, Gloucestershire, but she was too traumatised to give evidence and he walked free for a second time.Yesterday, Woodward, 27, was jailed indefinitely at Gloucester crown court and told he must serve a minimum term of eight-and-a-half years for the attack on the 18-year-old while she was walking her dog beside the River Severn in Gloucester last November. Woodward had threatened to kill his victim if she did not comply and ordered her to take off her clothes, however a dog walker heard the terrified teenager's screams and alerted police.Woodward was arrested just minutes later, but denied raping the woman. However, he changed his plea during the second day of his trial after the victim of the 2003 rape gave evidence against him.Speaking after the sentencing, Chief Inspector Geoff Brookes of Gloucestershire police said: "This is a dangerous man and we are pleased with the outcome of this investigation."We are continuing to develop our investigations into serious sexual assaults in conjunction with our partners, such as the health service and support groups, to ensure victims are fully supported throughout the process. Thankfully these type of offences are relatively isolated."
