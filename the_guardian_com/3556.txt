Growing up in Derby, Sanghera ran away from home at 15 to avoid a forced marriage. When her elder sister, terrified of her abusive husband, killed herself in 1987, Sanghera set up Karma Nirvana, a charity that has helped thousands of women, through its refuges in Derby and Stoke-on-Trent and its "honour" violence helpline. As a campaigner, Sanghera recently criticised the government's forced marriage protection orders - introduced in 2008 and under which young people are able to apply for legal protection from their families - saying they do not go far enough, and that breaches of the orders are rarely followed up.
