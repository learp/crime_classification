One of the UK's leading child protection officers came under fire from children's charities yesterday after saying that some paedophiles should receive treatment rather than face prison.Jim Gamble, from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), said offenders who viewed child pornography could be given a police caution and treatment rather than face a custodial sentence."We shouldn't be sending everyone that ever commits an offence - particularly of the viewing kind - to prison."He said it was time for a more "intelligent posture" in the fight against child abuse, adding that some offenders could be dealt with in the community, allowing them to maintain their lives and their families."[If] someone is at the beginning of the spiral of abuse, where there is evidence to indicate during the investigation that this person may well benefit from a police caution and be managed, then of course that needs to be done."Mr Gamble said that people with a "deviant sexual interest in children" should get help before they "live out that fantasy" and are caught.But charities criticised his comments yesterday, saying that watching child pornography was directly linked to the abuse of children.Michele Elliott, director of the children's charity Kidscape, said: "To treat them in the community sends a message that what they have done is not very serious. "If you download child pornography, you are just as guilty as the people who are taking the photographs. You create a market, because you want to view child pornography, therefore a child is abused for your pleasure. As far as I am concerned, that means prison."Ms Elliott said the length of sentence should vary depending on whether offenders had viewed child pornography or directly abused children - but she insisted both groups should face a custodial sentence. Donald Findlater, director of research and development at the child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, warned that Mr Gamble's comments could "diminish the gravity of child pornography".The NSPCC agreed that prison alone could not deal with those who sexually abused children. Its director and chief executive, Dame Mary Marsh, said: "Child sex abusers should be sent to prison when the severity of their crimes merits such a sentence. However, prison alone cannot deal with the scale of child sexual abuse."Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said policy should focus on stopping people offending in the first place.
