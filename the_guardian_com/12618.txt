Murders involving knives have fallen by 35% from 71 to 46 as part of an overall 4% decline in the crime rate, according to police recorded crime figures for England and Wales published today.The largest falls recorded by the police include a 12% drop in car crime, a 10% fall in fraud and forgery and 5% falls in gun crime and criminal damage.The police figures, however, record a 3% rise in domestic burglaries to 67,000 during the second quarter of 2009. This is the third rise in the last four quarters, apparently confirming fears that the economic recession is putting upward pressure on some forms of property crime. Robberies increased by 100 incidents to 19,600, snatches and other personal theft rose by 5% and bicycle thefts were up 22%.A study by the chief inspector of constabulary published at the same time as the quarterly crime figures shows that as many as 5,000 violent crime incidents, out of 421,000 recorded each year by the police as personal violence, may have been wrongly classified by the police as "no crimes". The study, which was ordered by the home secretary to investigate an apparent 22% statistical spike in the most serious offences earlier this year, revealed that there have been more than 320 changes and clarifications in the crime counting rules since 2005.Overall, the figures for April to June 2009 show a total of 1,168,300 offences recorded by the police – a fall of 4% compared with the second quarter of 2008.The latest results from the British Crime Survey, which is based on the personal experience of crime of 40,000 people, show a similar picture, with overall crime remaining stable in the year to June 2009, including a 4% fall in household crime and no change in the level of personal crime.The BCS also shows that the proportion of people who have high levels of concern about antisocial behaviour in their neighbourhood remains constant at about 16%, although there are some falls in individual worries such as teenagers hanging around the streets. For the first time, 50% of people feel that councils and police are dealing with crime and antisocial behaviour in their area – up from 45% a year ago.The 35% fall in knife murders represents a decline from 71 fatal stabbings between April and June 2008 to 46 between April and June this year. However, attempted murders with a knife rose by seven from 69 to 76 during the same period.The Home Office minister David Hanson said the continuing falls in recorded crime showed that the risk of becoming a victim remained historically low. He acknowledged the "upward pressure" on burglary, robbery and some theft, saying it had been met by a £20m package of anti-crime measures to "nip it in the bud".The "no crime" disclosure follows an investigation by the chief inspector of constabulary which found that 35% of a sample of 479 "no crime" decisions by police forces were wrongly classified and that victims did not get the service they deserved. The finding, based on a small sample, has triggered a more thorough investigation next year.The chief inspector, Denis O'Connor, said that investigators had to "get underneath" individual "no crime" decisions to find out why they had happened, but suggested it partly reflected the complex development of the law on assault during its 150-year history. The investigation found that in more than 60% of cases the decision to dismiss the allegation was correct and gave the example of a man who had claimed to have been assaulted in the high street but who was later found to have been injured by falling after leaving the pub.The shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, said the disclosure would further undermine confidence in the crime figures: "People are never going to believe in our police and criminal justice system unless they can be absolutely certain that they are being given a true picture of what's really happening."He said the increase in burglary rates in the newly published crime figures was worrying "since it is the unemployed who were most likely to be the victims, making life even tougher for them at the moment. But the rise in attempted murder with a knife is particularly alarming and just goes to emphasise how much still needs to be done to combat the culture of violence that exists in many urban areas."
