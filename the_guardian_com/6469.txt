As a result, we have launched a murder inquiry and are carrying out a detailed examination of the home and inquiries in the area. It is too early to comment on the cause of death, but a postmortem examination is due to take place tonight to help us establish what happened."Hayes Park, cordoned off by police last night, is in a cul-de-sac, surrounded by conifers, just outside Leicester city centre.
