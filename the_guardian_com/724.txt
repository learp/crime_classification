Police are warning the public of high-value scams involving forged banknotes, cheques and bank drafts as figures reveal a surge in cases.As the credit crunch forces people to part with items such as cars, crooks are taking advantage by paying with forgeries."Sadly, incidences of fraud are rising, and car buyers and sellers are right to be suspicious about exchanging often very large amounts of money with strangers," said Darren Gross of carPay.co.uk, a secure vehicle money transfer service for private buyers and sellers. "Cars are a great way for gangs to launder counterfeit money or cheques as they usually involve several thousand pounds at a time and most ordinary people wouldn't recognise a forgery. All the crooks have to do is take the vehicle to another part of the country and sell it to an unsuspecting buyer."Providing the new owner buys it in good faith, they have title to the car and the victim has lost everything."Of the 33 police forces across the country that released figures, 64% reported a rise in fraud offences last year compared to the previous 12 months. Often only small sums in forged Â£20 notes are involved but bigger frauds are on the increase.Forces reporting rises in fraud on last year included Central Scotland (82%), Tayside (75%) and Gloucestershire (43%). Sellers should take care not to part with goods until cheques had cleared, said Nicky Rose of the Trading Standards Institute.
