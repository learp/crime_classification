A newly elected MP who was spotted using her mobile phone while behind the wheel of her car was today banned from driving for six months.Yasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South-East, was also found to have no car insurance when stopped by police, Bolton magistrates heard.The former barrister and human-rights lawyer had been elected as the constituency's new MP on 6 May but four days later was caught by police while driving through the town talking on her mobile.The Labour MP, who was not in court, apologised to magistrates through her solicitor, who said she would now have the "inconvenience" of having to use taxis and public transport.Howard Sloane, prosecuting, said the MP already had nine points on her licence when she was stopped shortly before 3pm on 10 May by police who spotted her speaking into her mobile phone while driving her silver Vauxhall Astra along Wigan Road, Bolton.She had committed a previous offence of using her mobile phone while driving, in 2008, and two speeding offences, one in 2007 and the other last year.Ajmal Hussain, defending, said the MP had not deliberately avoided paying for insurance and blamed an administrative error.On the mobile phone charge, he said: "Her mother is not well and at the time her sister called and she answered. She clearly regrets the embarrassment that goes with it."He said Qureshi could have argued for "exceptional hardship" to try to avoid the driving ban, because of her job, but wanted to accept the ban. "She is going to be inconvenienced a great deal – visiting her constituents at unsociable times, she is going to have to now take taxis and public transport. It will affect her personal and professional life.Qureshi, of Morton Moss Court, Bolton, was banned from driving for six months, fined £950 for driving with no insurance, £300 for the mobile phone offence and ordered to pay £35 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
