Up to 15,000 police officers who are expected to take part in today's pay protest march through Westminster have been told to behave themselves and not to clash with any hostile counter-demonstrators.The Police Federation notes to marchers advises those taking part to wear "comfortable footwear", to use the toilet before marching, and to bring their own sandwiches.They are also warned how to deal with possible counter-demonstrations: "Our march has received a lot of media attention. It is possible that small groups with any grievance against the police may seek to stage counter-demonstrations."We would ask that you do not react to any taunts, do not get involved, and allow our Metropolitan colleagues to police as they see appropriate. We do not want other people's protests to become the story of the day."The anarchist group Class War has urged its supporters to be there to "boo-a-bobby", but it is expected that the police march will pass off peacefully.
