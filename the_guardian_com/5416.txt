Death records are to be released for the first time in a bid to stop fraudsters stealing the identity of the deceased, the government announced today.Each week, vetted organisations including credit reference agencies will be sent encrypted files containing details of everyone who has died in the UK.The move is aimed at reducing fraud by criminals who use obituaries and other information to build up an identity to open bank accounts, commit benefit fraud or aid illegal immigration.In one case that came to court last month, a 39-year-old Edinburgh man admitted to stealing the identity of a dead child to open a bank account and obtain credit cards. Over three years more than £200,000 passed through the account.This type of crime can be devastating for relatives of the deceased who have to deal with the consequences, as well as having a knock-on affect on legitimate borrowers as banks raise costs to recoup their losses. Around 12,000 records a week will be made available by the General Register Office for England & Wales, and its Scottish and Northern Irish counterparts.They will go to credit checking firms who have applied to receive the information under the initiative.The announcement comes at the start of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week, a government-backed awareness drive to warn of the risks of ID fraud.Figures suggest that the cost of the crime to the UK is in the region of £1.7bn every year. The UK's Fraud Prevention Service, Cifas, said that last year alone its members had identified 65,043 victims."Identity fraud continues to be a serious problem which we know helps enable other criminal activity such as benefit fraud, illegal immigration, illegal working, drug trafficking and terrorism," said Meg Hillier, the Home Office minister with responsibility for identity fraud.Peter Hurst, chief executive of Cifas, said there were still far too many people falling victim to ID fraud."Identity fraud is serious, and no-one should be complacent about it," he said. "Quite apart from financial losses, the effect on victims can be very distressing. Where a victim's identity has been seriously compromised it can be an extremely time-consuming and frustrating process to untangle the threads of deception.
