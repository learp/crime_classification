The government today shelved proposals to withhold housing benefit from nuisance neighbours, admitting it had failed to convince the public that the measures would reduce antisocial behaviour. Work and pensions minister Chris Pond said that although everyone agreed antisocial behaviour must be tackled, not everyone was convinced removing housing benefit was the right approach.Launching a public consultation on tackling antisocial neighbours, the minister said the government wanted to judge the effectiveness of existing penalties before bringing in new legislation.Ministers have already introduced antisocial behaviour orders - which make it a criminal offence for unruly individuals to harass, or cause alarm or distress in their neighbourhood - and acceptable behaviour contracts, written agreements banning antisocial behaviour. Mr Pond said: "All these measures will give councils a varied toolkit to tackle the blight of antisocial behaviour in their own areas. "We want to judge the effectiveness of the range of existing measures before introducing a new one. But we have not ruled out using other means in the future as we learn from experience and establish what works. "Nightmare neighbours should be aware that local authorities, local communities and the government are united in their determination to stamp out this unacceptable behaviour. People who won't accept that rights come with responsibilities face tough penalties."
