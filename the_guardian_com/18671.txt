Early this morning they arrested a 26-year-old man from Addiscombe, Surrey. Another two men arrested on Sunday, aged 25 and 26, were released on police bail. Her family appealed for any witnesses to the attack to come forward: "Sally Anne's parents and sisters love and miss her so much and wish to stress that if anyone has the slightest information about Sally Anne's death, even if they don't think it is important, please come forward."The part-time hairdresser joined local agency Pulse Model Management in January and had her catwalk debut at the Swatch alternative fashion week in April."I would love to be compared to Kate Moss because she is just so amazing. To be where she is one day would be brilliant," she said at the time."My close friends have been very supportive of my modelling but some of them have been difficult - but I guess that's life," she said. "At the moment I'm the happiest girl in the world."Pulse director, Peter Kaminski, described Ms Bowman as " a lovely, bubbly girl who had the world at her feet"."Sally was so good we had decided to make her the face of Pulse," he told the Daily Mail. "We believed she was going to be the new Kate Moss."Ms Bowman had been out with friends on the night of the attack and police showed CCTV footage of her taken just a few hours before it happened.The murder weapon was still missing and police said they were keeping an open mind on the motive, but a postmortem examination showed that Ms Bowman had bled to death from multiple stab wounds. Police believe the attack took place between 4.30am and 6.30am.Detective chief inspector Stuart Cundy, who is leading the investigation, said the killing was "the loss of a young woman's life in terrible circumstances".
