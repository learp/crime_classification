Police have arrested two people after uncovering a sophisticated money counterfeiting operation on a remote industrial estate in Kent.Kent police officers, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and the Bank of England have raided a building on the Woodfalls industrial estate in Laddingford, near Yalding. Inside a small unit that was believed to be vacant they found printing equipment with the potential to print millions of pounds of fake Â£20 banknotes and fake bills in various stages of production. A police spokeswoman said the notes were of a very high quality.Officers from forensic units wearing protective suits examined the scene. It is understood that one of the arrests was made on the site.A house 30 miles away in Faversham was searched in an operation linked to the investigation."We believe that the equipment we are examining could be capable of producing millions of pounds' worth of counterfeit currency," said Detective Inspector Eddie Fox of Kent police. "This type of crime can cause millions of pounds of damage to the economy but can also have a devastating impact on individuals who are duped into accepting worthless notes."Paul Luckhurst, the owner of Autograph Contracts, a car leasing company based on the same rural industrial estate, said there was no sign of any activity in the unit."It is a very small privately run industrial estate and there was a little business in there that closed a month ago and we thought it was empty," he said.
