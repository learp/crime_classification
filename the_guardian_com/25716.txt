National park planners yesterday announced a £500 reward to track down vandals who have smashed public lavatories in the Peak District.A possibility is that it is the work of someone with a grievance against the Peak park's planners. In the worst attack, wreckers used sledgehammers and pickaxes to demolish most of the front wall of a toilet block at the White Lodge car park off the A6, near Monsal Dale in Derbyshire. It was the fourth act of vandalism there in three months and will mean £15,000 of repairs and the toilets out of use until after Easter. The White Lodge toilets opened in the mid 1990s, with advanced, environmentally-friendly composting techniques at a site without mains water or electricity. The attack there follows others at popular rural areas in Miller's Dale, Tideswell Dale and Derbyshire Bridge. Residents have complained that plans for house extensions may be turned down in the park while companies, because of permission granted before the park's inception 50 years ago, can still extract quarry stone.
