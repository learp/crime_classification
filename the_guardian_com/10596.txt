An acclaimed headteacher has denied committing a string of historic sex offences against a boy.Anne Lakey, 54, won national recognition as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools after overseeing the biggest improvement in GCSE results in the country.She appeared at Consett magistrates court on Tuesday for a brief hearing, where details of the eight alleged offences on the boy, who was under 16, during a 12-month period in the late 1980s were read out.Lakey denies two counts of inciting a boy under 16 to commit an act of gross indecency, two counts of gross indecency on a boy under 16 and four counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16.The offences were said to have occurred when the defendant was a teacher in her late 20s,. The alleged victim was not a pupil.Asked if she wanted to indicate a plea at this first hearing, Lakey, of Stanley, County Durham, replied: "I do indeed. Not guilty."Richard Copsey, defending, said: "She strongly denies these allegations."Magistrates sent the case to the crown court.Lakey was granted unconditional bail and will appear at Durham crown court on 28 January.The federation where she was chief includes Durham Community Business College in Ushaw Moor and Fyndoune Community College in Sacriston.Fyndoune was last year named the country's most improved secondary school after the number of pupils achieving at least five GCSEs, including maths and English, rose from 26% to 80%.Both colleges were judged outstanding by Ofsted in 2011.
