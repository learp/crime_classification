Two men who threw a firework into a care home, leaving a resident with life-changing injuries, have been jailed.Donna Stringer, who has learning difficulties, had to be rushed to hospital in a critical condition and suffered severe burns to her arms and neck during the incident in Barking, east London, in November last year.The 43-year-old was asleep at Lynnwood care home when a firework was thrown into the building, sparking a blaze.Sabbir Ahmed and Muhammad Aktaruz Jaman Khan, both aged 23 and from Bethnal Green, pleaded guilty to intending to destroy or damage property and being reckless as to whether life was endangered.Ahmed was jailed at Snaresbrook crown court for six years while Khan was jailed for seven years.DI Niall McSheffrey, of Barking and Dagenham police, said: “Donna has had a hard start in life and the actions of Ahmed and Khan have caused unnecessary anxiety and stress to the Stringer family and it is not clear what psychological injuries Donna has suffered.”Investigating officer DS Karl Dines said: “I’m glad that these two defendants are now behind bars for this heinous crime. They have left a permanent physical and emotional mark on Donna and her family. They temporarily displaced six other vulnerable people from their homes and caused tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage.”
