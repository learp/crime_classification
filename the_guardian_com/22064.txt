A 15-year-old girl was arrested today on suspicion of murdering an 18-year-old mother who was stabbed in the street.The victim, Samantha Madgin, was caught up in a row between two gangs in a back alley in Wallsend, near Newcastle, at around midnight. Northumbria police said a 15-year-old girl from the Newcastle area was arrested this afternoon on suspicion of murder. A man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s were already being questioned, also on suspicion of murder, and more suspects were wanted, the force said.Police said Ms Madgin was in one of the two groups involved in "an altercation". Chief Superintendent Steve Storey, commander of the North Tyneside area, said: "We received a call about a disturbance in Wallsend in the back lane between Victoria Avenue and Albert Avenue around 11.50pm. "On arrival we found the victim had suffered stab wounds. She died later from her injuries." Ch Supt Storey said that knife crime was rare in the area and police took robust action against anyone carrying a blade. "I'd also like to remind people we do not have the same level of problems with gang culture as other parts of the country and the majority of incidents involving knives are when the victim and offender are known to each other in some way - a random attack by a stranger is rare," he said.
