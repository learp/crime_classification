A murder investigation was launched yesterday after a holidaymaker was knocked down and killed by a car thief outside an airport terminal.Michael Howard, a 57-year-old father of three who worked for Mawdsley-Brooks, a Salford-based pharmaceutical company, was knocked down moments after he took his suitcases out of the boot of his silver Volvo estate at Liverpool John Lennon airport.He had arrived at 5.30am and had been due to catch a flight to Malaga with his wife, who had left the car to find a luggage trolley.Merseyside police said last night they had arrested a man in connection with Mr Howard's death.A spokeswoman said: "We arrested a 19-year-old man from the Woolton area in connection with the incident."Officers are actively seeking others who may be involved."While Mr Howard was dealing with their luggage, a thief jumped into the front seat of the car and tried to drive it away.Mr Howard ran in front of it in an attempt to stop the theft, but was knocked over and became trapped under the wheels.Fire crews attempted to free him from beneath the car, but when the paramedics arrived he was pronounced dead.The car thief leapt out of the vehicle when it stalled and jumped into a maroon Rover 216, driven by an accomplice. It was found abandoned less than a mile from the airport.It was the third attempted carjack at the airport in the past six months, despite patrols by a private security company and CCTV cameras trained on the area.Mr Howard's wife, Elaine, who saw the incident, is traumatised. She is being comforted by their children, Jonathan, David and Lisa, at their home in Hesketh Bank, Preston, Lancashire.In a statement released through the police, she said: "This was a happy time that we were really looking forward to."The people who have done this had no regard for Michael's safety or anyone else. Michael was a much-loved husband and father and we are completely devastated by what has happened."Someone must know who has done this and we would ask that they please come forward and speak to the police."We would like to be left to grieve in peace and to try to come to terms with Michael's death, but we want to help the police."Police covered the car - with its boot still open - in green tarpaulin while tests were carried out. The couple's luggage was left beside the vehicle on the pavement. Detectives believe that at least two people were involved in the incident.Robin Tudor, corporate affairs manager at the airport, said it was an "absolutely horrendous incident" and their thoughts were with Mr Howard's family."This is the first time anything like this [death] has happened," he said. "There was a car taken in similar circumstances in December belonging to David Coulthard's father, but thankfully no one was injured."In that incident, it would appear they were followed to the airport."Mr Coulthard's Â£50,000 Volkswagen Touareg four-by-four was stolen in last month's incident."It is a public area and the only alternative is to introduce draconian security measures and interrogate everyone, which would make it very inhospitable," Mr Tudor said."If we put it into context with 3 million-plus passengers a year, we have to be mindful that it is very rare."Mr Tudor said that in view of the current terrorism alert, security at the airport was ex tremely tight. But he said the airport would be reviewing its security arrangements.A security worker, who did not want to be identified, said the carjacking was witnessed by an early morning cleaner."We were told he was hysterical, but there was nothing he could do," he said."Usually there are car park attendants at the drop-off point making sure that people do not park there, but they were an earlier shift to us. I don't believe there was anything that they could do any way. It is such a tragedy."Chief Superintendent Greg Wood, of Merseyside police, who is leading the murder inquiry, described it as an "absolutely despicable and cowardly act".He said Mr Howard's wife was being comforted by police officers and she was in a "dreadful state"."She is so upset we have not been able to get anything out of her. At the moment she's just in shock."
