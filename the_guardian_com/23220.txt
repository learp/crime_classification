The mother of Shannon Matthews has been found guilty of kidnapping the schoolgirl by drugging her and having her tethered to a wall in order to claim reward money offered for her safe return.Karen Matthews, 33, and her accomplice, Michael Donovan, 40 - the uncle of Matthews' former partner, Craig Meehan - were today convicted of false imprisonment, kidnap and perverting the course of justice.The pair concocted a plan in which Shannon was held in Donovan's flat for 24 days, drugged with temazepam and travel sickness tablets, and confined by an elastic strap with a noose on the end, a three-week trial was told.Following the verdicts, which took the jury six hours to reach, Justice McCombe warned the pair that they faced a "substantial custodial sentence".He said he would adjourn the sentencing for reports. No application was made for bail and the two defendants were led away.Hear Martin Wainwright's report from DewsburyOutside court, Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan, the senior investigating officer from West Yorkshire police, condemned the pair."Karen Matthews is pure evil. She started deceiving those closest to her from the very moment that Shannon was kidnapped. Friends, neighbours and family were under the clear impression that Shannon was genuinely missing,'' he said."They had no reason to believe that Shannon had been taken as part of an elaborate scam or hoax. "It's difficult to understand what type of mother would subject her own daughter to such a wicked and evil crime."Nine-year-old Shannon, a pupil at Westmoor junior school in Dewsbury, went missing in February after a school swimming trip. Her apparent disappearance prompted a search by police across West Yorkshire that cost almost £3.2m.Matthews had placed a 999 emergency call to police to report her missing and followed it up with many impassioned pleas through the media for her daughter's return.Police found Shannon hidden inside the base of a bed in Donovan's flat on March 14. They smashed their way into the flat after reports of strange noises from neighbours. A search found Traveleeze tablets, a prescription for drugs including temazepam, and a copy of the Sun newspaper containing references to a £50,000 reward.Prosecutors told Leeds crown court that far from being grief-stricken, Matthews was "a proven, consummate, skilful and convincing liar".The jury heard how Donovan broke down within minutes of police finding Shannon in his flat, a mile from her home. He burst into tears on his arrest and told detectives: "Get Karen down here. We'd got a plan. We're sharing the money - £50,000."The pair had planned to release Shannon in Dewsbury market where she would be "found" by Donovan, who would then have claimed the various rewards.Matthews denied the abduction and blamed the crime on her former partner, Craig Meehan, and other members of his family. She said she was "disgusted" by allegations that she was involved in her daughter's kidnap.Donovan claimed he was scared of Matthews and agreed to take Shannon only because he feared for his life.Throughout the search, one of the largest ever conducted by West Yorkshire police, there were 200 officers mobilised, 1,800 properties searched, 1,760 cars stopped and three-quarters of all the UK's police dogs used.Speaking outside the court, Malcolm Taylor, from the West Yorkshire Crown Prosecution Service, described Shannon's kidnap as a "cynical plot"."This was a story of total disregard for the family and indeed for the public,'' he said."Karen Matthews and Michael Donovan seemed honestly to believe that they could stage the disappearance of Matthews' own daughter and benefit financially from the huge wave of public sympathy that would inevitably follow."This was an abuse of public trust, public services, the public purse and worst of all Matthews' own daughter for personal gain."
