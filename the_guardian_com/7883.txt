The solicitor general, Mike O'Brien, today said the government needed to make tackling domestic violence a much higher priority.Speaking at the third annual conference on domestic violence earlier this afternoon, Mr O'Brien said it was time to put more emphasis on a crime "with more repeat victims than any other"."Domestic violence is a social evil which cuts across age, class, ethnicity and sexuality", he told delegates."It is the most frequent cause of death amongst women aged 19-44. Victims of domestic violence suffer on many levels, it affects their health, housing, education and means they lose their freedom to live life without fear."But he said progress was being made. Special courts dealing solely with domestic violence are in the process of being set up in 25 locations across England and Wales.Prosecutors in the courts will be specially trained in dealing with domestic violence, and victims will have a special advocate to guide them through the whole process.A pilot scheme of a court in Caerphilly saw the number of guilty pleas relating to domestic violence rise from 21% to 61%, and a fall in the number of complaints withdrawn by the victim from 53% to 17%.Mr O'Brien said: "There is an increasing body of evidence to support the finding that specialist courts which provide experts in domestic violence mean more perpetrators are brought to justice."He also confirmed that the review of the country's murder law, which began in July, will focus on the perceived injustices in the way it deals with victims of domestic violence."There is concern that the law at present may deal mercifully with a man who kills his wife."Mr O'Brien said changes needed to be made to the defences of provocation and diminished responsibility in murder trials.
