Police hunting for the killer of American artist Margaret Muller today arrested a 18-year-old man in east London.Scotland Yard said the man was being questioned at an East London police station after his arrest at 6.20am at his home in Hackney.Ms Muller, 27, was stabbed several times in the neck and back while on a morning run in Victoria Park, east London, on February 3. She was discovered by dog-walkers and other runners who responded to her screams, and park keepers attempted to revive her. On Monday, police staged a massive reconstruction of the crime, with 93 potential witnesses retracing the routes they took just before and after her murder. The reconstruction, the largest of its kind in Britain, produced several new leads, police said. Police said that about 90% of the people in the park at the time of the murder returned for the reconstruction, including 11 who had not spoken to the police before. Detective chief superintendent Jon Shatford said on Monday that the killer may have taken part in the reconstruction, putting himself in a different position. If he had not returned, he would be noticeable by his absence. Police said they believed the attack was motiveless and that the killer, believed to be a local man, may strike again. "He may have approached other women in this park, and may have been building up to this for some time," Mr Shatford said. "The killer was a stranger to Margaret Muller, not a stranger to the area or the park."Ms Muller, a painter from Falls Church, Virginia, had lived in a one-bedroom flat in Hackney, near the park. She had graduated from the Slade School and Fine Art in London two years ago.
