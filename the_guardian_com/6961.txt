Prisons are seriously misleading the Home Office by providing grossly inflated figures for the time inmates spend involved in activities out of their cells, the chief inspector of prisons has revealed.Anne Owers says that as jail overcrowding has increased, prisons have sent in statistical returns that record "unrealistic and undeliverable" amounts of time spent out of cells instead of facing the difficulties of providing decent regimes.In her annual report, published yesterday, the chief inspector says the rise in the prison population to a record 77,800 in the past year has led to improvements in many prisons being stalled and good prisons going backwards.Ms Owers reveals that the considerable strain now being faced by local prisons is being masked by figures inflated to meet key performance targets. "In nine out of the 18 local prisons, and four out of the 12 training prisons we inspected the figures recorded seriously misrepresented the real outcomes," she says. "There is little evidence that these misleading returns are queried either within or outside the prison. Such practices merely serve to disguise the scale of the problem."The chief inspector said that at Dorchester prison the absence of sufficient activity for prisoners was disguised by greatly exaggerated monitoring figures. The prison had been claiming prisoners were out of their cells on average for more than 13 hours a day; the reality was around 6.5 hours, as staff readily acknowledged when the inspectors visited.On the prison ship Weare, at Portland, the figures bore so little relation to reality that some landings had pre-printed forms with the hours spent out of cell already entered before they were distributed."At Bristol, over 40% of prisoners said they spent less than two hours a day out of their cells ... [the] lamentable situation was disguised in the statistics recorded."At Winchester jail 1,850 hours of "purposeful activity" were added every week to the Home Office return for prisoners cleaning their cells, yet they were not provided with cleaning materials.Even though so many prisons have been inflating their returns the prison service still missed its national target of 24 hours a week of "purposeful activity" for prisoners the last time a figure was published in 2004. Such activity includes education, tackling drink and drug abuse, anti-bullying initiatives, prison and pre-release work and family visits.A prison service spokeswoman yesterday said they recognised that over-recording of purposeful activity had happened but claimed it was not general practice. "We have adopted a vigorous approach to improving the integrity of this data," she said. "The prison service is committed to increasing the amount of genuinely constructive activity available to prisoners."
