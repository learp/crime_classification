 Detectives investigating the murder of a man whose remains were found in three different locations within the space of nine days were investigating the discovery of another body part in Hertfordshire, police said today.A spokeswoman said officers were at the scene but it was too early to say what had been found. An arm and leg were found in different locations in Hertfordshire, seven days apart last month, before the man's head was discovered about 80 miles away, in Leicestershire, on 31 March.Hertfordshire police were called by a member of the public at 12.43pm today to a layby on the northbound carriageway of the A10 Puckeridge bypass, said the spokeswoman. The area was cordoned off and a lane closed to traffic.Forensic tests showed that all three previous finds came from the same body. Police from Bedfordshire & Hertfordshire major crime units were conducting a joint murder investigation, with officers from Leicestershire constabulary.The man has yet to be identified and no cause of death has been established. Officers are continuing to check through missing person reports and look through dental records.A full DNA profile has been obtained and there was no match on the national DNA database, which means the victim did not have a criminal record.The victim is believed to be a white or Asian adult male, between 5ft 6ins and 5 ft 10ins tall. His shoe size is believed to be between a 7 and a 9. He also had a skin condition which caused discolouration in the pigmentation of the skin around the ankle, giving a bleaching effect, and he suffered from eczema, which caused the skin to scale.The left leg of the man was discovered in a green holdall next to a layby on the A507, just outside Cottered, on 22 March. An arm was found 24 miles away on 29 March, in a verge in Drovers Lane, Wheathampstead. The head was discovered in a field near Asfordby.
