Portuguese police searching for Madeleine McCann today said they did not have enough evidence to arrest a British man questioned as a formal suspect.Robert Murat, 33, was questioned for more than 16 hours yesterday as a named suspect - an "arguido" - before being released early today.Speaking today at a press conference in Portimao, Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa said: "We further interviewed a 33-year-old man who lives in the area where the incident happened. We have not able to find enough evidence to arrest this man or to charge him but we have continued to investigate."We are continuing with this investigation. There are direct relations with what we did yesterday."Mr Murat, who grew up in Portugal and returned to the country two years ago after going to live in England, has signed an identity and residence statement which requires him to regularly report to police. He is unable to move home or leave the country.He was interviewed along with a Portuguese man and a woman, understood to be German, who have also been released.Mr Murat lives less than 150 metres from where the four-year-old vanished from the holiday villa where she was staying with her family in Praia da Luz.Under Portuguese law, an arguido is someone who is being treated by police as more than a witness but has not been arrested or charged.Five properties - one thought to be the Casa Liliana where Mr Murat lives with his mother Jenny - had been subject to forensic examination to find information "that will enable us to hopefully locate little Madeleine", said Ch Insp Sousa.Mr Murat was brought to the attention of the police by the British press after he was seen regularly crossing the police tape outside the McCann family's holiday apartment.The 33-year-old made himself known to journalists on Friday May 4, the day after Madeleine disappeared. Lori Campbell, a Sunday Mirror journalist, reported him to local officers as well as to the British embassy and Leicestershire police.Mr Murat's cousin, Sally Eveleigh, told Sky News there was "absolutely no way" he could have anything to do with Madeleine's disappearance, saying he could "sometimes ... be over-helpful to everybody".For a spell, Mr Murat lived in the village of Hockering, Norfolk, with his ex-wife, Dawn, before returning to Portugal, where he had spent much of his childhood.Hockering villager Geoffrey Livock, 71, said he did not know anyone who disliked Mr Murat, adding: "Like we were saying in the pub last night, he would rather help than hinder anyone."Two women, each carrying a child in a blanket, emerged from the house in Hockering yesterday. A spokesman for Norfolk police said no one at the address had been arrested and nobody in the village was being questioned.Madeleine vanished on May 3, when it is thought she was taken from her bed while her parents ate dinner at a restaurant next door. Yesterday, her father, Gerry, said the family believed she was safe and being looked after.
