An illegal immigrant was found guilty today of conning the attorney general, Lady Scotland, into hiring her as a cleaner.Loloahi Tapui, who knew she had overstayed her student visa by four years, duped Scotland into hiring her as a housekeeper for just £6 per hour.A jury of eight men and four women at Southwark crown court in London took less than 90 minutes to find the 27-year-old Tongan guilty of fraud.Tapui, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were returned, will be sentenced on 7 May for fraud, possessing a false identity document and for overstaying her student visa. She was bailed and will be electronically tagged.The judge, Nicholas Loraine-Smith, told the defence counsel, Christopher Hehir, that Tapui "must understand that the grant of bail is not a promise of how she will ultimately be dealt with".Tapui was cleared of possessing false identity documents with intent.Tapui was employed by the attorney general at her home in Chiswick, west London, in January last year.Scotland, the chief law officer for England and Wales, was fined £5,000 for failing to take copies of the documents that Tapui claimed showed she was entitled to work in the UK. Scotland told the court she "bitterly regrets" her mistake.The row catapulted the 54-year-old minister, who helped form the law under which she was censured, into the centre of a political controversy which saw one of her key aides resign.Scotland said Tapui had breached her trust. The defendant knew how important honesty and abiding by the law was to her and her family, but had lied nonetheless, she said.Scotland denied she had been so busy with her work that she simply assumed Tapui had the right to remain and work in the UK because her husband, Alex Zivancevic, was a lawyer and spoke with an English accent."I thought this woman was married to a member of the legal profession," she said. "It never crossed my mind that a lawyer in this country would be married to an illegal immigrant and then pass her off as a cleaner to the attorney general."You would need to be brain-dead to do something like that."The minister said she hired Tapui at a difficult time in her personal life, a week after the funeral of her brother and a little over a month after her mother died.Tapui sold her story to the Mail on Sunday for £95,000, with the publicist Max Clifford taking £19,000 commission.Tapui told the jury she came to the UK in 2003 to visit her aunt. She met her husband-to-be later that year and decided to stay as she was enjoying "a good life".She admitted taking her CV and pay slips to the interview with Lady Scotland, who she knew by her married name of Patricia Mawhinney, in a bid to convince her that she was legally entitled to work in the UK because she was desperate for work.When the truth emerged about Tapui's immigration status, on 16 September last year, Scotland sacked her by text, sending Tapui's husband the message: "Alex, this is really shocking. I have to terminate Lolo's employment with immediate effect. I do need to speak to Lolo. Patricia."Tapui said she paid £180 cash to a Russian called Alex for a fake visa stamp, but denied knowing it was fake.Tapui, of pleaded guilty to possessing a passport with a counterfeit visa stamp between June 7 2006 and September 19 2009, but was cleared of using it to establish facts about herself and earn money.
