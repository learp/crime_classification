Tony Blair is to unveil a crime-busting superforce to tackle organised drugs, vice and money-laundering operations at a national and international level.The Organised Crime Agency, to be announced early next week, will combine elements of police and law enforcement units, such as the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) and Customs, with highly-skilled financial and technology specialists to fight increasingly sophisticated global criminal cartels.The government hopes the agency will eradicate counter-productive competition between various police units and other security organisations.The post-Hutton era has emphasised the need for shared intelligence, which will be crucial to the success of the agency. GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 already liaise with the police to a degree, and there are some police officers working within the security services, but the intention is to strengthen links.It should also save money in the long term by annexing units like the National Crime Squad and NCIS, which have annual budgets of £130m and £90m respectively, and avoiding costly duplication."At the moment the system works in spite of itself, but there's room for improvement with better coordination," said a senior police source.Many policing organisations, such as the Association of Chief Police Officers and the NCIS, accept the need for a more coordinated strategy to deal with national and international organised crime - termed level 3 crime - and are largely in favour of the agency.It should also free up more officers to deal with local crime - level 1 - and cross-county, more widespread internal crime, termed level 2. But police chiefs are concerned about how the agency will operate in practice, whether it will drain resources from level 2 work and whether their particular interests will be given sufficient emphasis."The whole National Criminal Intelligence Service approach to this has been to say, whatever happens, intelligence will be at the heart of it," said an NCIS spokesman."It makes sense that it is intelligence-led," said a police source. "You can't hope to search every container coming from Rotterdam. You have to have some idea which ones are likely to be full of drugs."Barry Irving, director of the Police Foundation, an independent policing thinktank, said: "There is lots of speculation about how the new force might be managed. In the past, it has proved very difficult to find out what's going on in the National Crime Squad and NCIS, and one wonders whether the management culture issues are now going to be addressed."There has been speculation the new force will be similar to the FBI. But, unlike the FBI, which parachutes federal agents into US states to investigate specific cases, the UK agency will concentrate on providing expert information and analysis to undermine entire criminal networks.Ministers also hope it will avoid criticism levelled at the FBI, whose agents are accused of being elitist and divorced from grassroots policing."It won't be the A team, breaking down doors and nabbing the bad guys," said a senior police source. "It has to be much more subtle."Another police source agreed: "The days of high profile bogeymen like the Krays and cops drawing drug gang pyramids on the back of envelopes are long gone."Some of new agency's top targets might never even have set foot in the UK. Nevertheless, they make billions of pounds a year running, from abroad, the prostitution, cocaine and heroin dealing rings which bring misery to British streets."The agency will use traditional detective skills, but it will also employ innovative methods to bring international crime's "Mr Bigs" to justice. Tracking the proceeds of crime will form a substantial part of its brief, and, like the FBI, could employ a high proportion of well-qualified accountants.It will draw staff from the police - the National Crime Squad, the NCIS, Special Branch - and the investigative elements of Customs and the Serious Fraud Office, with input from MI5, MI6, and GCHQ.It is believed, however, that responsibility for combating terrorism will remain with Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad. Neither will the new agency tackle illegal immigration into the UK.Although it will have direct links with all UK-based groups fighting organised crime, its core workforce will be relatively small, at 4,000-5,000.The top post will be widely advertised, and will not necessarily be filled by someone running one of the units which will form part of the agency.A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: "We are relaxed about the boss of the new agency not being a police officer as long as there is a healthy representation of police interests."The government plans to install a shadow managerial team to get the Organised Crime Agency going as soon as possible, although legislation could be required before it is fully implemented.
