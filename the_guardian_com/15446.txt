No one will be prosecuted for failures of infection control at an NHS trust where 90 patients were killed by the Clostridium difficile superbug, police said yesterday.A Healthcare Commission investigation last year identified serious malpractice at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals in Kent. It found wards and washing facilities were filthy and patients were left to lie in their excrement. Inspectors said the trust was so focused on meeting government targets and dealing with high levels of debt that it failed to deal properly with outbreaks of C difficile infection in 2005 and 2006.But a nine-month inquiry by Kent police and the Health and Safety Executive did not find sufficient evidence to lay charges against the trust or any of the managers responsible.Allyn Thomas, Kent's assistant chief constable, said it had not been possible to identify any single act that was grossly negligent, justifying charges of manslaughter.Sandra Caldwell, deputy chief of the HSE, said it could not charge the trust with corporate manslaughter under tougher health and safety legislation which came into effect in April and was not retrospective.The Healthcare Commission came to its conclusion on "the balance of probabilities," but the police and HSE required a higher standard of proof that was "beyond all reasonable doubt".
