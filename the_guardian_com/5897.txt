The son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour apologised yesterday for swinging from a union flag on the Cenotaph during the student protests on Thursday. Charlie Gilmour, 21, said he was "mortified" by his "moment of idiocy", after he climbed on to the memorial to Britain's war dead in Whitehall.Gilmour, a history student at Cambridge University, said he was deeply ashamed. "I would like to express my deepest apologies for the terrible insult to the thousands of people who died bravely for our country that my actions represented," he said in a statement. "I feel nothing but shame. My intention was not to attack or defile the Cenotaph. Running along with a crowd of people who had just been violently repelled by the police, I got caught up in the spirit of the moment."He apologised to other protesters, saying that his actions had detracted from the cause the protests were trying to highlight.
