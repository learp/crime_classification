A high court judge demolished a key plank of the government's crusade against yob culture yesterday by ruling it illegal for children to be forcibly removed from curfew zones.Lord Justice Brooke found in favour of a boy aged 15, from Ham, south-west London, who claimed that the antisocial behaviour powers amounted to a breach of his human rights.Under the 2003 Anti Social Behaviour Act, any unaccompanied under 16s going into a curfew zone while the ban was in force - between 9pm and 6am - faced a police escort home, whether or not they were suspected of bad behaviour.The boy, known only as W in court, challenged the powers, with the support of the group Liberty, because he feared that the police could pounce on him as he went about his business, either to the local Tesco or to his band practice. He is one of a group of teenagers around the country who are seeking to challenge the new anti social behaviour law.The judge said yesterday it would be illegal under the act for a police officer to forcibly take a youngster home. Police can ask children under the age of 16 to go home but they cannot make them obey, he said.The ruling is a blow to the campaign of the home secretary, Charles Clarke, against so-called yob culture. It reduces significantly police powers in about 400 dispersal zones in the country.Alex Gask, Liberty's legal officer acting for W, said: "This is a victory for the presumption of innocence, and the right of everyone, no matter what their age, not to be subjected to coercive powers without good cause."The Home Office said it would fight the ruling, even though the government was refused leave to appeal by Lord Justice Brooke."We believe that the police should be able to use reasonable force to take children home, otherwise the police are not able to do anything if a child refuses to be taken home," a Home Office spokesman said.The test case arose after the Metropolitan police set up dispersal areas in Surrey, Richmond town centre and Ashburnham Road, Ham.Police told the court they had concerns in Richmond "that large numbers of people, often fuelled by binge drinking, became involved in incidents of low-level antisocial behaviour". It had become a significant issue for the town.In Ham, problems were limited to the Ashburnham Road area, where there were scores of disturbances in public places, and reports of graffiti and criminal damage to vehicles.Lord Justice Brooke said W, who was 14 at the time of events cited, was not removed from either "dispersal area" but his case had raised "issues of general importance about the powers of police and community support officers in relation to children and young persons under the age of 16."The judge said W was "extremely distressed" to be told off on one occasion by a police officer and did not feel he could return to the town centre in the evenings without his parents. "He could not even meet his friends or go to the cinema because he might be picked up by a policeman or community support officer, and he did not want the ignominy of being taken home by the police," the judge said.W also felt unable to take a bus home after band practice in nearby Kingston and suffered the "embarrassment" of having to rely on someone else for a lift home.The judge said there was no power in common law to force children off the streets and the Anti Social Behaviour Act did not give officers that power. "All of us have the right to walk the streets without interference from police constables or CSOs unless they possess common law or statutory powers to stop us."Parliament had not intended the police to be able to forcibly remove children from the zones because that would be in breach of the UK's international obligations to "treat each child as an autonomous human being".In a statement after the ruling the boy said: "Of course I have no problem with being stopped by the police if I've done something wrong. But they shouldn't be allowed to treat me like a criminal just because I'm under 16."Tony Arbour, leader of Richmond council, was "very disappointed" by the decision. The powers had been a useful tool "in our armoury" to keep the area safe.The zones would be "infinitely less effective" and youngsters, knowing they could not be escorted home, might "stick two fingers up at police who ask them to disperse".Kathy Evans, spokeswoman for the Children's Society, welcomed the ruling: "Home Office figures show that youth crime is decreasing. It is time to stop targeting and demonising young people as the cause of the problem and include them properly as citizens and members of their communities."Nathan Poole, 15, from Thornton Heath, Lancashire, one of the teenagers campaigning against the antisocial behaviour laws, said: "Police have stopped me and told me to go home just as I was coming away from youth meetings. It makes me angry that they had these powers. If we are not causing problems there is nothing wrong with us hanging around."Potholes on path to street justice· A plan to make speeding motorists pay an extra £5 to compensate crime victims was shelved after protests from motoring groups and the public.
