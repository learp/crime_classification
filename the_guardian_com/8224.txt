Wandsworth prison has been given six months to improve performance or face compulsory privatisation, it was warned today.The south London prison has been given the deadline to come up with an action plan which tackles its performance, by Martin Narey, the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). He issued the warning after the 1,440-inmate prison was scrutinised under the government's performance testing programme which rates it against other prisons.If Wandsworth's action plan is approved the prison will be awarded a service level agreement, allowing it to stay in the public sector. But if it fails the prison will be contracted out to the private sector. A prison service spokesman said the prison had been making progress but "the pace of change has not matched that of other local prisons". It was faltering on developing resettlement work and effective offender behaviour programmes, he said. Mr Narey, who is responsible for the performance testing programme, said that he was not trying to shame the prison into improving. Instead he hoped that "staff will use this to effect real change for themselves and their prisons," he said. But he added: "There will be no compromise on this. Governors and their staff must know and understand that we are committed to improving standards and need to work together to achieve this end, otherwise I will have no hesitation in contracting the prison to the private sector."Mr Narey also issued a similar warning to Hindley young offenders' institution in Wigan, Greater Manchester, which has six months to come up with its own action plan to improve performance.The prison service director general, Phil Wheatley, said: "Hindley and Wandsworth are already making significant progress and I am confident that the performance testing will increase the momentum and enable them to move quickly towards high performance status."
