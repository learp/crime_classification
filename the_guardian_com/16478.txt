Offenders will be able to avoid the courts if they agree to face alternative justice meted out by their local community, under "tough liberalism" plans unveiled today by the Liberal Democrats.Positive measures would also be introduced to give low level criminals such as joy riders an incentive to stop reoffending. This could include sending them on go-karting expeditions or attending car mechanic courses, according to the party's home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten.He insisted offering a "carrot" was not a soft liberal policy, but a proven way to prevent reoffending. "Matched with a penalty I am absolutely convinced - and I know from the evidence of where this is trialled - that doing that stops them going out and nicking a car the following Thursday, because they are looking forward to the car mechanic session and the go-karting and they don't have the need to nick the car and go joyriding."The scheme would be part and parcel of attending community justice panels, staffed by trained community volunteers, which would look at antisocial behaviour and other low-level crimes. This would allow offenders to avoid a conviction and possible jail sentence, which often results in high rates of reoffending within the youth population, Mr Oaten explained. Speaking of the justice panels, Mr Oaten said: "Compared to sitting comfortably in court and receiving a fine, going before one of these panels will be a very uncomfortable experience.""I want offenders to see the anger and hurt they cause to those living in their streets and their communities. But this is not just about punishment. It offers the offender something that a court appearance cannot: a chance to earn back the respect of the community and demonstrate that he can act responsibly."Mr Oaten reiterated his plans to close down city prisons and use the cash to fund the scheme, revealed earlier this week by Guardian Unlimited.He said at the time that by tackling low-level crime at the outset there would be less need for prison places up and down the country.However, in an apparent change of tack, Mr Oaten said earlier today that new prisons would be built on the outskirts of towns within five years to replace those sold off.He confirmed that under a Lib Dem government five year term, Â£500m would be earmarked for prison education, training and drug rehabilitation.
