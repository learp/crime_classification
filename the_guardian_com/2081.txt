Police are hunting three men who carried out what is thought to have been the first carjacking in Surrey, when they forced a woman from her car on Epsom Downs yesterday.The woman in her 60s was forced from her silver convertible Mercedes at 3am, having been tailed on her way home from London. The thieves overtook as the woman approached a roundabout on the Old London Road, and pulled over in front, forcing her to stop. Police said two black men then got out, smashed the drivers' side window and forced the woman from the car. She was made to lie face down on the road while the thieves took her handbag and drove away in her car. A third man, believed to have been driving the vehicle in which the thieves tailed the woman, is also wanted. Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton of Surrey police said: "There's no evidence a firearm was used on this occasion but these were obviously violent criminals who may well be armed." Police warned the public not to approach the gang, but urged anyone who was in one of the car parks in the area, or who saw the Mercedes, perhaps being tailed before 3am, to get in touch.
