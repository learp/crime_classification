A man who was jailed for life after trying to blow himself up in a restaurant in a failed suicide attack has died in prison.Nicky Reilly, 30, was found dead in custody at HMP Manchester on Wednesday, a Prison Service spokeswoman said.In May 2008 he accidentally set off a homemade nail bomb in a toilet cubicle as he prepared to target dozens of customers.Reilly, a convert to Islam from Plymouth who had Asperger syndrome and learning difficulties, was described as the “least cunning person ever to have been charged with terrorism” and injured only himself in the blast inside the Giraffe restaurant in Exeter. He pleaded guilty to attempted murder and preparing an act of terrorism and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years in 2009.A Prison Service spokeswoman said: “HMP Manchester prisoner Mohammed Rashid Saeed-Alim died in custody on Wednesday October 19. As with all deaths in custody there will be an independent investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman.”Reilly decided to carry out his attack on the restaurant after being encouraged by others on the internet. He had intended to run out into the packed dining area holding three bottles filled with caustic soda, paraffin and nails to his stomach.But he got stuck in the toilet as he prepared the blast, and one of the bottles went off before he could leave the cubicle.The explosion sent dozens of restaurant customers fleeing in panic and the bomber staggered out having suffered serious facial injuries.Reilly had converted to Islam between 2002 and 2003 and was soon telling others about his interest in jihad. In 2004, he changed his name to Mohammed Rashid Saeed-Alim, and began to download videos on bomb-making and martyrdom from YouTube.He received encouragement in an internet chatroom from two people with Arabic names, and he described himself as “Ali the Brit”.Reilly was intent on becoming a “martyr” by killing himself and others and wrote: “That is my dream.” He considered bombing Plymouth’s Charles Cross police station and Drake Circus shopping centre, as well as Devonport dockyard.In a rambling note written in red ink and left in his bedroom, Reilly described how he was motivated by the “disgusting” behaviour of people in Britain as well as the “war on Islam”. He claimed he had not been “brainwashed or indoctrinated”.
