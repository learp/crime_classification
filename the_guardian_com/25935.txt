A Canadian schoolteacher suspected of sexually abusing young boys across south-east Asia was seized by Thai police today after an unprecedented global manhunt by Interpol.Christopher Paul Neil, 32 - allegedly seen raping boys as young as six in 200 images posted on internet sites - was arrested at a house he rented with a Thai boyfriend in the north-eastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima.The arrest followed a tip-off, and jubilant Thai police drove their captive the 150 miles to Bangkok.Mr Neil was paraded before a press conference where he sat impassively in dark wrap-around sunglasses as officers explained that he would be charged with molesting under-age boys and faced 20 years imprisonment.Interpol detectives were equally elated after a unique nine-day campaign, in which they appealed for help in tracking the suspect down, resulted in his arrest.They said the operation would serve as a warning to paedophiles that the power of the internet, and public revulsion, would leave no hiding place.The international police agency revealed Mr Neil's picture after German computer specialists used cutting-edge technology to unscramble his features. His face had been digitally obscured with a swirl pattern in images showing him abusing boys in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.Within days, Interpol had received 350 calls and messages that established his name, age, nationality, passport number, occupation as an English teacher and current and previous places of employment.However, on the day the pictures of Mr Neil were released, he abruptly left the South Korean school at which he was teaching. He arrived at Bangkok's international airport, where Thai immigration authorities photographed him, shaven headed and wearing glasses, sparking a nationwide search.Police in Bangkok issued an arrest warrant after a Thai teenager approached them alleging the teacher had abused him several years ago.Mr Neil lived in Thailand - where he was known as "Vico" - on several occasions between 2002 and 2004, when the images of him abusing the boys were uploaded.Interpol followed up with a "red notice" international wanted persons warrant, a precursor to extradition proceedings.Mr Neil was tracked to the home of a 25-year-old Thai transvestite nicknamed Ohm, in Nakhon Ratchasima, after a trace was put on his mobile phone. He was arrested this morning, but said nothing except for confirming his name and asking for a lawyer."The suspect was quiet," Lieutenant General Pongsapat Pongcharoen, of the Thai police, said. "He wasn't agitated. He didn't say anything at all."The handcuffed suspect, with a blue shirt over his head, was led through a scrum of media into Bangkok's police headquarters. He sat beside Thai officers who explained he could be held for 48 hours before they charged him or sought an extension from a judge.General Wongkot Maneerin, Thailand's deputy national police chief, said Mr Neil could be charged with sexually molesting young boys. If convicted, he faces 20 years in jail over accusations he paid two Thai boys of nine and 14 for oral sex.Interpol detective Mick Moran said the international appeal using the web proved highly successful because Mr Neil had been positively identified by five sources on three continents within days."The irony that we used the internet to publicise our message is not lost, in that he or somebody originally posted images of him abusing children on the internet," he said.
