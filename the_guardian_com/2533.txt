A tumultuous week for Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, continued yesterday when one of his former leading aides was charged with fraud.Ian Clement, the former deputy mayor for external relations, will appear in court on Tuesday charged with five counts of abusing his expenses.It caps a rough week for the Conservative administration in London.Johnson and his handpicked head of policing came under fire for claiming they had seized control of the Metropolitan police. Kit Malthouse, the deputy mayor for policing, told the Guardian he and the mayor had "their hands on the tiller" of Scotland Yard, drawing a furious reaction from the Met commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson.Clement, one of five top aides to the mayor to be forced from office since Johnson won power in May 2008, was told yesterday he would be facing criminal charges. The decision was made by the Crown Prosecution Service after an investigation by Scotland Yard.Scotland Yard said: "Ian Clement, age 44, from Crayford, Kent, has this morning been charged with five offences under section 1 and 2 of the Fraud Act in connection with alleged misuse of expenses."Clement, who will be appearing at City of Westminster magistrates court, resigned his post in June after the allegations came to light.He was alleged to have used a corporate credit card, intended to be used only for official business, to pay for meals for his girlfriend.Meanwhile, the mayor and the Tories nationally are hoping their row with Scotland Yard dies down.Johnson, who chairs the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), is standing by his lead official on policing, while the MPA tried to clarify Malthouse's views by saying he was not seeking to give the police orders over operational matters.The authority said: "He is – as are all members of the MPA – quite clear as to the respective roles of the authority and the commissioner and has never sought to exercise improper influence over operational policing in London, which is plainly the responsibility of the commissioner and his senior colleagues in the Met. It is right though that the Met is held to account for its performance in reducing crime and making London safer and this is where the authority sets priorities and monitors achievements."Malthouse told the Guardian the Met would no longer set its own priorities; he and Johnson would make the decisions, along with the MPA, with input from other authority members.But a former MPA chair has said this clearly impacts on operational policing.Lord Toby Harris used his blog to say: "It is the proper role of the MPA to set the strategic priorities and the budget for the Met. To pretend that this does not impact on operational performance is ridiculous. It is what having an accountable police service is all about."
