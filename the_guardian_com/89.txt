Amanda Knox, the American exchange student accused of killing her British flatmate in Italy for refusing to play a sex game, is today expected to take to the witness stand at her trial.Meredith Kercher, 21, from Coulsden, Surrey, who was studying at Perugia's University for Foreigners, was found in November 2007 in a pool of blood.Prosecutors allege she was killed during what began as a sex game, with Knox, 21, touching her with the point of a knife while Knox's Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, held her by the shoulders.Prosecutors have alleged that a third person, the Ivory Coast national Rudy Hermann Guede, tried to sexually assault Kercher and then Knox fatally stabbed her in the throat. Guede was convicted of the murder in a separate trial last year and sentenced to 30 years in prison."She's a bit nervous about going on to the stand, but she's also quite confident in what she has to say and that the truth will come out during her testimony," Knox's father, Kurt, told CBS's Early Show in the US."She is going to be telling the truth and answering all of the questions, and hopefully the court will see that and see that she had nothing to do with this and that she's 100% innocent."He said that during the testimony his daughter would be speaking Italian, which she mostly learned during the year and a half she has spent in jail.Prosecutors claim Knox's DNA was found on the handle of the likely murder weapon – a kitchen knife found in Sollecito's house – and that traces of Kercher's DNA were on the blade.Knox and Sollecito, who have been remanded in custody since shortly after the killing, have given conflicting statements over their whereabouts on the night of the murder.Knox initially said she was at home and covered her ears as Patrick Lumumba, the Congolese owner of a bar where she worked, killed Kercher. Lumumba was cleared after being detained for two weeks, and Knox has since retracted the statement but it can be referred to in evidence.Sollecito has said he was at his own flat in Perugia, working at his computer. He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it.The two face life imprisonment if convicted of murder. The trial began in January and a verdict is expected after a summer break.Guede was given a fast-track trial at his request. His appeal against the conviction is due to start in November.
