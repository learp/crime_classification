An internationally known flautist lost an irreplaceable collection of instruments when rioters burned her Croydon flat to the ground in the weekend disturbances.Carla Rees, 34, is reeling from the loss of at least 10 flutes, including two Kingma flutes specially made for her in the Netherlands on which she has based her international contemporary music career.She has also lost her music library, including a unique collection of 600 pieces of unpublished music written for her and her ensemble Rarescale, complete with composers' comments that she says are almost as important as the sheets of music themselves.Her two cats died in the fire, which gutted the building on London Road where she had her second-floor flat. The whole building will be demolished. "I am lucky to be alive," said Rees, who studied at the Royal College of Music in London.She and her boyfriend had just come back from a weekend coaching the National Youth Wind Orchestra, when they encountered gangs of youths and smashed cars in the street. Fearful of the atmosphere, they grabbed clean clothes, fed the cats and booked into a hotel. An hour later, her home was in ruins.Carla does not know what the future holds for her. Most of her work musically has been based around the instruments destroyed in the fire. These have to be made by hand and cannot be quickly replaced. She is thankful she still has photos from the wedding she was hired to shoot last Friday, and most of her PhD work, which she was preparing for submission in January, because she happened to have a hard drive in her bag.The music world has rallied round to help with money and offers of help. A website has been set up for people wanting to donate.
