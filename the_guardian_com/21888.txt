A millionaire's daughter has been jailed for two years for driving looters on a late-night crime spree at the height of last summer's riots.Laura Johnson, 20, chauffeured the group through London on 8 August in her black Smart car.As they drove around the capital, her passengers leapt from the car clad in hooded tops, bandanas and balaclavas to loot.The University of Exeter undergraduate, from Orpington, Kent, was jailed at the Inner London crown court for two years for one count of burglary and two years for one of handling stolen goods, to run concurrently.Johnson and her accomplice Christopher Edwards, 17, were both convicted of burgling a Comet store at the Greenwich retail park and stealing electrical goods between 7 and 10 August as rioters brought chaos to the capital.They were also convicted of handling stolen goods following a trial in April.Edwards can now be named after a ban prohibiting the publication of his name was lifted.The teenager had previously admitted burglary by stealing alcohol and cigarettes from a BP garage in Charlton.Edwards was told on Friday he would serve 12 months at a young offender institution.The court heard Johnson set out early on the evening of 8 August to deliver a phone charger to her friend Emmanuel Okubote, 20, a convicted cocaine dealer and thief, known as T-Man.When they met in Catford, south London, he jumped into the passenger seat while three others climbed into the back.Johnson told police she was told to drive from one place to another over several hours as violence spread across the city.When she stopped, her passengers – most of whom she claimed to have never met before – looted and robbed people, including fellow looters, at knifepoint.Johnson – who is reading English and Italian at university – is a former grammar school pupil who reportedly achieved four A*s and nine As at GCSE.She is the daughter of Robert and Lindsay Johnson, who own the direct marketing business Avongate Ltd.The couple sat at the back of the court on Friday as Martin McCartney, mitigating, described how their daughter led a "privileged life with a caring family".He said that on the night in question Johnson, whom he described as a "bright, intelligent and articulate" young woman, acted in a "moment of madness".He said: "At the time of the offence, placing what she did against the background of who she is, this was completely out of character."It is not beyond the realms of reason that the way she acted might have been affected by the emotional turmoil she was in."The court was told that Johnson's mother wrote a "heartfelt" letter to the judge, describing Johnson's "self destructive behaviour" at the time.During the trial, jurors were told that she had previously tried to kill herself while struggling with mental health issues.The student broke up with her boyfriend last April, triggering depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.She told the court that almost a month before the riots she was raped by two men at a boy's house but she did not tell anyone at first.
