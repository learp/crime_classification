Police looking for Rachel Moran, the woman who has been missing since heading home after spending New Year's Eve in a pub in Hull, today arrested two men.The arrests follow the discovery of the body of an adult female at a property in Nash Court on the Orchard Park estate in Hull.Humberside police today took the unprecedented step of searching private homes in their hunt for the missing 22-year-old.Since Ms Moran's disappearance all open areas and watercourses within a mile radius of her last sighting on Hall Road, Hull, have been searched by teams of specialist officers.Her Irish passport, mobile phone and left trainer have been discovered since she left her parents' home in Hall Road to walk the short distance back to her home in Sax Court. She had spent the night celebrating with her brother, John, at a local pub and planned to spend the night at her parents' home. But after her boyfriend, Mark Shepherd, phoned her to tell her he had gone to a party, she decided to walk home to feed her four-month-old kittens. Ms Moran's mother, Wanda, had begged her not to leave but Rachel set off, dressed in a red party dress, a jacket and trainers that she changed into.Earlier today Ms Moran's parents appealed for anyone who knew of their daughter's whereabouts to come forward, during an interview with GMTV.Her father, Ray, said: "I'm clinging to the good things really, there's two good things - that she's been abducted and is being held somewhere against her will, or for some reason she's took it in her head to disappear, which is unlikely because she's too soft-hearted and sentimental not to be in touch with us."Please, if you're holding her against her will or for anyone who knows or even suspects what might have happened, just let somebody know."
