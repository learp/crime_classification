Many residents using a government-backed antisocial behaviour hotline say nothing has changed as a result of them reporting their concerns, according to a study published for the Home Office.The It's Your Call (IYC) hotline was set up at the beginning of the year in 25 areas of England to encourage members of the public to report incidents of antisocial behaviour.But the results of the study into the experience of users of the hotline service, buried on the Home Office website, suggest public expectation is being raised without action actually being taken in the majority of cases.The problem appears to be recognised by the government, which is seeking to introduce stronger powers for police and councils to curb antisocial behaviour.Earlier this week, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, vowed to eliminate antisocial behaviour by 2010.By 2008 every household will have the names, phone numbers and email addresses of their community police officers, Labour party conference delegates were told earlier this week.But the report, produced by research company Vision 21, found the most common result of the call was that the problem remained unchanged.The evaluation was based on a telephone survey of 95 callers to the IYC hotline in Blackburn, Burnley, Oldham, Oxford, Salford, Sheffield, Slough, and Swindon.Some 57% of those who resorted to the helpline to report local difficulties said nothing changed. Fewer than one in five (18%) felt that things had got "a lot better" as a result of their call; a further 25% said the situation had got a "little better" after calling the hotline.The common theme for dissatisfaction was when callers complained of "teenagers hanging around in the street".Yet the majority (82%) said they would call the number again, suggesting that the helpline gives people an outlet for their frustrations on antisocial behaviour in their area.More than four in five (83%) said they would recommend the hotline to friends or neighbours. On the whole, the hotline failed to discourage all respondents from calling the local police as well, with 44% calling both the hotline and the police to try and get the problem resolved.But several people who turned to the helpline said they would have not reported it at all otherwise. Eight percent would not have bothered to report the antisocial behaviour at all if the hotline had not been in place, while 6% would have liked to but would have been unsure who to turn to.Almost all of those interviewed said they had not received leaflets highlighting use of the hotline.A Home Office spokeswoman said the study was meant to learn lessons as early as possible to see how the hotline was working in practice. "obviously It's Your Call is going to take time to be fully effective, but it was important to learn all we could from the interim evaluation", she said."It is a complex issue and involves a range of agencies and it is diffificult to tackle it immediately."
