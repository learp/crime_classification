Britain's organised crime agency is being investigated by the police watchdog over concerns that it could have done more to prevent the gangland killing of a shopkeeper in an organised crime hotspot.It is the first time a killing linked to an investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) has been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.The inquiry centres on the murder 12 days ago of Nasar Hussain, 30, in Salford. Hussain, who came from a village in Pakistan, had only been in the UK six months when he was attacked as he worked behind the counter of Brookhouse Wines supermarket.He was shot with a Mach-10 submachine gun by a masked man who burst into the shop late in the evening of Saturday 4 July.When officers from Greater Manchester police's armed response team arrived at the store minutes later they found that Hussain, known locally as Nazar Shazad, was fatally wounded.There had been no attempt to rob the shop, and it emerged that the armed response team had been alerted to the threat by investigators from Soca, who were involved in an inquiry into an organised crime gang in another part of Manchester. The city has been identified as one of four main organised crime hotspots in the UK and is a focus for activity by Soca.It attracts criminal gangs from all over the UK whose reach extends far beyond the north-west.It is understood that Soca investigators were alerted to the threat to the supermarket as a result of their operation, although it is not clear whether they were aware that Hussain was the intended target.They are understood to have informed Greater Manchester police of the threats, but it appears that the force was given another location to attend before being redirected to the supermarket.By the time the team reached the supermarket it was too late. A postmortem showed that Hussain died from six gunshot wounds to his chest and stomach.His father, who lives in Pakistan, was informed of his son's death and spoke of his devastation.Detective Superintendent Mary Doyle said after the murder: "It is always incredibly difficult for a parent to hear the news their child has died but the barriers of distance and communication have made it that bit harder."Sources say the inquiry will focus primarily on Soca, which was responsible for passing on the intelligence to Greater Manchester police. Investigators will examine what information was known by the agency in the days leading up to Hussain's killing.The IPCC investigation could provide crucial information on how the agency operates with major crime units in forces all over the country at a time when the government wants Soca and the police to work closely together to tackle criminal cartels.The IPCC will examine whether Hussain should have been issued with an Osman warning, a tactic used when specific intelligence is received that an individual is at serious risk of being killed.The warnings are most often used to alert potential victims of organised crime gangs such as businessmen, drug dealers and other gang members. Less specific warnings of a threat to life can also be issued, including a threat to a company, premises or someone who has not been named.Last year Greater Manchester police issued 225 Osman warnings â€“ the most in the country.Naseem Malik, the IPCC commissioner involved in the inquiry, said Greater Manchester police and Soca had referred the Hussain killing to the IPCC."We have decided to conduct an independent investigation to establish whether either organisation knew or could have done anything to prevent his death."A 19-year-old man has been remanded in custody at Manchester magistrates court charged with the murder of Hussain.
