The former BBC radio DJ Dave Lee Travis has made his first appearance in court charged with 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault against nine alleged victims over a 30-year period.Standing in the dock at Westminster magistrates court, the 68-year-old gave his name as David Griffin, "also known as Dave Lee Travis".He is accused of committing the offences between 1977 and 2007 against alleged victims aged between 15 and 29.His lawyer, Martin Bale, indicated that the former Radio 1 and Top of the Pops presenter would be pleading not guilty. The case was sent to Southwark crown court, where a pre-trial hearing will be held on 6 September.Griffin, of Mentmore, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, arrived at the court to be met by a media scrum and refused to comment on the case against him. He has denied any wrongdoing since he was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences last November.Inside court one, he was asked to enter the glass-panelled dock. He asked the court usher: "Why am I in here? Why am I not out there with my lawyer?"Dressed in a smart grey suit, white shirt and patterned tie, he stood in the dock and spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth. His lawyer indicated he wished the case to be heard at crown court.Izolda Switala-Gribbin, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the matter was not suitable for the magistrates court and should be heard at crown court because the allegations were of "calculated and prolonged" behaviour and the sentencing powers of magistrates might not be sufficient.District judge John Zani sent the case to Southwark crown court for trial. Griffin was released on bail with the conditions that he stay at his home in Mentmore and does not contact the alleged victims.Outside court, Griffin, whose radio show on Magic has been off-air since his arrest, said: "I am supported by my wife and friends."
