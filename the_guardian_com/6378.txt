Police are under pressure to launch an investigation into the Royal Bank of Scotland's £12bn rights issue after a complaint by a member of the Scottish parliament.The Lothian and Borders force confirmed yesterday it was conducting inquiries into whether the bank fraudulently sought investment from shareholders, many of them UK pension funds, knowing that the bank was insolvent.Much of the focus of the investigation is expected to centre on the former boss Sir Fred Goodwin and his team of executives, who masterminded the bank's debt-fuelled rise to become the world's fifth largest bank before its fall from grace.At the time of the rights issue, Goodwin and his team assured investors the bank was solvent and able to chart its way through the credit crunch.Scottish National Party MSP Christine Grahame has asked the police to investigate whether shareholders were misled.Her call comes days after the bank - which has its headquarters in Edinburgh - revealed it was on course for the biggest loss in UK corporate history as it expected to write down as much as £28bn from the falling value of its assets. The bank, almost 70% of which is now owned by the state, has seen its market value plunge from £75bn two years ago to about £4.7bn.Grahame argued that the true state of the bank's finances should have been disclosed at the time of the rights issue last April. "If you are misleading people into thinking this is a stable investment ... it's a criminal offence," she said.Grahame has also written to Scotland's top law officer, the lord advocate, Elish Angiolini, with her allegation. An RBS spokesman declined to comment.Alex Salmond, the first minister, said: "I'd favour a parliamentary investigation, not just into the Royal Bank of Scotland - as it is only one of hundreds of banks worldwide which has got into serious trouble - but into the financial sector."
