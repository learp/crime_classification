Despite yesterday's conviction of four animal rights activists, Huntingdon Life Sciences still takes extraordinary precautions to continue trading. The company was once listed openly on the London stock exchange, but this meant that for a small fee protesters could buy access to the company's shareholder register, allowing them to widen their campaign of intimidation to target investors. Soon trading in Huntingdon's shares petered out as City dealers refused to touch them and the company's share price nosedived.Huntingdon switched its official headquarters to the US, setting up a new holding company in Maryland, where investors remain anonymous unless they own more than 5% of a company. This new shell company, Life Sciences Research (LSR), took over Huntingdon at the start of 2002.LSR was ready to join the New York stock-market in 2005 but abandoned its move at the last minute amid fears of a violent protest in the US. Eventually LSR made it to the NYSE Arca exchange, which uses an electronic trading system that makes it harder to trace which individuals or institutions are trading in a company's shares. Earlier this year, LSR was worth around $400m (Â£272m) before it was sucked up in the stockmarket downturn.Huntingdon says it has not suffered as a result of its flight to the US, reporting revenues of $236.8m last year, a 23% increase on the previous year. But it still has to use the UK government for banking and insurance facilities because financial institutions fear they will be targeted by activists if they are linked to Huntingdon. Its managing director, Brian Cass, has accused the financial services industry of treating Huntingdon as "radioactive".
