The Soham double murderer Ian Huntley is being treated for scalding injuries at Wakefield prison in West Yorkshire after another inmate attacked him with boiling water. The former school caretaker, who is serving two life sentences for killing 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in August 2002, is in the health wing of the high security jail. A Prison Service spokesman said yesterday that an investigation had begun into the attack, which took place on Wednesday. Huntley, 31, has been threatened regularly with revenge attacks for the killing of the schoolgirls.
