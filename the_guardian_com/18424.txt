Prison watchdogs fear overcrowding is jeopardising security and has led to a sharp increase in assaults and suicide attempts by inmates, according to a report published today.The Prison Reform Trust's report, which brings together for the first time the views of official boards of visitors for more than 100 prisons in England and Wales, called for urgent action over the prison population. The boards of visitors, the official watchdogs for each prison, said that overcrowding meant that many inmates were being held in either the wrong security conditions or in unsuitable parts of prisons. The findings show that the number of incidents involving assaults and cell damage is rising. Even the prison ship, the Weare, moored in Portland harbour, Dorset, which was brought in to relieve prison overcrowding, reports that it is "running close to full". The Parkhurst board said that too many inmates were being "doubled up" in cells, giving rise to fears of a repeat of the racist murder of Zahid Mubarek at Feltham young offenders' institute, west London. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "This unique report must act as a wake up call to the government to reduce prison numbers."
