High street shop assistants who were trained as special constables by Scotland Yard have cut the level of thefts and fraud in their stores by half.Volunteers from the Dixons group of electrical stores received the same training as the Met's 765 part-time officers under a pilot scheme. Officials said they had been able, as a consequence, to spot more offences and deal with those most likely to commit them. The trial, in Camden, north London, was judged so successful that the project manager has been seconded to work with the Home Office, with a view to the same idea being tried nationally. A Dixons spokeswoman said the Met's training gave the six staff in its two Camden stores a better understanding of how crime occurred. "This has made them more aware," she said. "They are in tune with the potential for crime and are more confident about dealing with it." Richard Barnes, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said the pilot project had proved its worth. "This is something we would advocate to other police services. It has worked really well." A recent survey estimated that retail crime costs the industry £2.25bn annually. Antony Rumming, 22, a Dixons team leader in Camden said the training had helped him to catch 20 potential fraudsters in the last year. "It helps knowing what they are going to do and the patterns involved," he said "If someone tries to buy a £1,500 laptop and doesn't ask anything about it, alarm bells ring. We also benefit from local intelligence, so you get to know who these people are." Scotland Yard has also drawn up plans to expand the role of special constables and enhance their status. Measures designed to increase recruitment and ease the pressure on full-time officers will see more specials given meaningful supporting roles in major investigations, including murder inquiries. Civilian accountants have already been given special constable training and will assist the Met in cases involving complex forensic accounting.
