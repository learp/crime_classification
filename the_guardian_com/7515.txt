Dixons Kings academy, where a teacher has been stabbed, has been a troubled school almost from the moment it first opened four years ago.Although the circumstances of the stabbing on Thursday are unclear – and the violent incident has no apparent relation to the Bradford school’s free school status – it is another unhappy chapter in its short history.One of the first free schools to open in 2011, it was known as the Kings Science academy when it was feted by the then education secretary, Michael Gove, as part of his flagship education policy, and personally visited by the prime minister in 2012.But not long after David Cameron’s visit and warm praise for its headteacher and founder, Sajid Hussain Raza, Ofsted inspectors rated the school as “requires improvement” and criticised its leadership, management and teaching processes.Worse was to follow when the school’s finances came under scrutiny. An investigation by the Department for Education’s funding agency was leaked, containing charges against senior management. The published report eventually concluded that the agency “found serious failings in financial management”.Further controversy followed, aided by dogged reporting by the Yorkshire Post, which revealed that the DfE’s investigation was not passed on to West Yorkshire police. Fraud charges against Raza and four other staff members followed after Raza was arrested in January 2014. Raza denies the charges. He was later dismissed by the school after a disciplinary investigation.The school was also embroiled in controversy over the involvement of a local businessman, Alan Lewis, a vice-chairman of the Conservative party, whose company leased the property the school is built on to the DfE in a deal worth nearly £6m.The school at one point named Lewis as its chair of governors. But Lewis said the listing was a mistake and that he had never occupied the role. Instead, he was the school’s “executive patron”.In September last year, the school was taken over by the Dixons academy trust, a chain of academies and free schools which runs other successful schools in Bradford, after further inspections by Ofsted criticised the school’s management.
