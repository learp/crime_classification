Detectives have arrested a man after a clubber was shot dead at a London nightclub early Sunday morning.The 35-year-old victim from west London was shot outside Club Red in Limehouse, east London. A man in his 20s handed himself in at a south London police station last night. He is in custody and being questioned.The victim, who has not been named, is the 90th person murdered in the capital this year, police said. He had been attending a house music event with friends.The man had multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene.The shooting is being investigated by officers from Operation Trident, which focuses on gun crime among young black people.While concerns about London street violence have recently focused on knives, Trident has more than 300 officers working full-time on gun crimes.Last week, a 17-year-old became the third teenager to be gunned down in Camden, north London, since May, fuelling fears of a turf war among local gangs. The victim was believed to have known Sharmaarke Hassan, also 17, who died two months ago after being shot in the head on a Camden estate. His death followed the shooting of an 18-year-old in the stomach in nearby Archway.Last week it emerged that the latest fad among gun-wielding criminals is a tiny key-fob gun that can fit easily into the palm of the hand. On Friday, Marcus Henry, 27, from Clapham, south London, was jailed for nine years at the Old Bailey for shooting a man with one of the miniature weapons outside a nightclub in December 2007.Police said it was the first example of the weapon being used.Around 100 of the Bulgarian-made devices, designed to be used as flare guns, were imported into the UK a few years ago, and some have been converted to fire live 0.25-inch rounds.Police say they may be even more dangerous than standard handguns because they can be more easily concealed.
