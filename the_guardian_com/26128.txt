An investigation into the apparent murder of 'God's Banker', Roberto Calvi, the Italian financier whose body was found hanging beneath Blackfriars bridge in central London more than 20 years ago, is closing in on a number of suspects living in Britain. City of London police have identified UK residents whom they want to question in relation to the mysterious death. The investigation has had a dramatic breakthrough thanks to the re-emergence of evidence discarded 10 years ago by the City of London Police and the Home Office. A forensic report, paid for by Calvi's family, established that it was impossible that Calvi killed himself. Once discarded, this report has now become crucial evidence in the investigation - one of the most intriguing of recent times. City police hope to make a further breakthrough in a matter of weeks. The Italian authorities, who have identified four suspects, are close to launching a trial. Calvi was president of the Milanese Banco Ambrosiano, which acted as banker to the to the Cosa Nostra as well as to the Vatican's financial arm and an influential Masonic lodge, P2. Calvi's bank went under with debts of £800,000 - the same amount of money transferred out from it just before it collapsed. The City of London police said the lead investigator was not a mason. Jeff Katz, the man hired by Calvi's son to prove his father did not commit suicide and now chief executive with Bishop International, a leading investigation firm, said: 'The family paid for extensive investigations. Part of it involved forensic science, reviewing the police investigation and carrying out further work. We proved that Calvi's death could not have been a suicide, but until now the UK authorities chose to ignore these findings.' · Pope John Paul II is 6/4 favourite to win the Nobel Peace Prize with Cantor Index.
