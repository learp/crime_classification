Failure by the Government to deal with hardcore drug addicts stealing to feed their habit is being blamed for record levels of shoplifting, a crime that is becomingly increasingly violent.Recorded thefts from shops in England and Wales rose to 309,397 last year, up from around 306,000 in 2002, according to government statistics released to Parliament last week by Home Office Minister Paul Goggins. Thefts have risen more than 20 per cent since 1990 - when the number stood at 250,000 - and are more than double the number for 1970. The rise contrasts sharply with figures released last week showing an overall fall in non-violent crime in 2003. Retailers say the statistics tell only a fraction of the story. 'Detected crime represents between a tenth and a twentieth of the actual crime,' said Michael Schuck of the British Retail Consortium. 'The reality is now anything between four and five million shoplifting incidents a year in the UK.' The total value of goods stolen is thought to be about £500m a year, an estimated of £100 a year for each household. Experts say the vast majority of thefts are by gangs of hardcore drug addicts who co-ordinate attacks on stores. An authoritative study in Scotland found that the average addict commits 300 offences a year, mostly shoplifting. Criminologists estimate that in certain cities, such as Brighton, only around 30 offenders carry out most of the thefts. 'Shoplifting has serious economic consequences. It turns places into no-go areas at night as people are put off venturing into town centres,' Schuck said.
