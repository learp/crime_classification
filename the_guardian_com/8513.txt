Children who kill could escape a life sentence by pleading "developmental immaturity" under proposals published yesterday for the biggest shake-up of murder law in over 50 years.Under the recommendations, part of a Home Office review of murder, children who kill "in circumstances suggesting incomplete moral development of mental functioning" could claim their responsibility was diminished and their crime should not be punished by a life sentence.The law commission, which drafted the recommendations, received expert evidence that some youngsters from neglectful homes had poor behaviour control as a result of a stress response affecting their brains and their ability to make proper judgments. The reform would open the way for shorter sentences in future for young killers like Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, who murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993 when they were 10. Sir Roger Toulson, the high court judge who chairs the commission, said most children and young people who killed came from disturbed backgrounds. The law on diminished responsibility "doesn't take account of how screwed up emotionally and in every other way they are because of the way they've been brought up", he added.Such cases would be covered by a less restrictive definition of diminished responsibility, which would make it easier for severely depressed battered women who kill their abusers to avoid a life sentence. The reforms' main plank is a two-tier offence of murder, with mandatory life sentences retained for only the more serious killings - where the murderer intended to kill. Those who intended only to cause serious harm or who were grossly reckless as to whether death occurred, and those who successfully plead provocation or diminished responsibility would fall into the lower category, second degree murder. Life would be the maximum sentence but judges would be free to sentence according to the circumstances.Many killings in fights, robberies and burglaries, where the offender intended to cause serious harm but not death, now fall into the single category of murder, which carries an automatic life sentence.Far fewer would be likely to get life sentences if the reforms are adopted. No figures are available but it was suggested in a House of Lords case that more than half of murders are not intentional killings.The law commission, the official law reform body, has put forward the proposals for consultation as part of a review announced last year by the then home secretary, David Blunkett. A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We are considering the proposals but there will be no compromise on the mandatory life sentence for murder." The commission said the law of murder was "a mess" which had caused the courts "great difficulties" over the last 50 years. After three months' consultation, it aims to produce final recommendations next autumn, with a view to an act to replace the 1957 Homicide Act.The commission rejects the idea of US-style categories of homicide, where a crime is more serious if the victim is a law enforcement officer or if it happens during the commission of certain offences. But it proposes a "ladder" of homicide offences topped by the two tiers of murder.Below that would be manslaughter - killing through gross negligence or while committing a crime, or with the intention to cause harm or recklessness over harm.Mercy killing would remain in the most serious category, with an automatic life sentence. But the reform of the defence of diminished responsibility would make it easier for severely depressed carers who killed a loved child or partner to bring themselves within second degree murder.The defence of provocation would be tightened, making it harder for a man to argue successfully that he was provoked into killing his wife because she threatened to leave him. That would probably bring some cases now considered manslaughter into first tier murder with an automatic life sentence, said Dr Jeremy Horder, the law commissioner responsible for the report. Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair gave his backing yesterday to a system which recognised different degrees of murder.Shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve said: "If first degree murder is to be confined solely to those who intend to kill their victims and excludes those who intend to cause their victims 'serious harm' through deliberate violence, then a message will go out about the acceptability of violence that is massively counter-productive to creating a peaceful society."Main points· Two tiers to replace current single offence of murder· Only first degree murder would carry a mandatory life sentence· Second degree murder to carry a maximum, not mandatory, life sentence· Manslaughter redefined· Provocation and diminished responsibility only a partial defence to first degree murder· Mercy killing remains murder
