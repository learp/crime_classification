An indecent picture alleged to be of schoolgirl Tia Sharp was taken after she had died, a court heard on Thursday.The picture, which shows a naked girl on a bed but does not show her face, is claimed by prosecutors to be an image of the 12-year-old taken on the night she was murdered last year.It was found on a memory card hidden on a door frame at the house Tia's grandmother, Christine Bicknell, shared with Stuart Hazell, who is accused of murdering the girl some time between 2 August and 10 August 2012.It is alleged that Hazell, 37, sexually assaulted the schoolgirl before killing her and hiding her body in the loft at the house in New Addington, south London, where she was found a week later.On Thursday forensic pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl told a jury at the Old Bailey that in his opinion, the person in the photograph was dead when it was taken."When I saw the photograph, there were changes in the body that suggested to me the individual was dead," he said.He told jurors that there was "irregular mottling" on the back of the thighs that made him come to this conclusion, and suggested the girl had been left lying on her back for some time after death.Fegan-Earl said it was not possible to come to a definite conclusion about the cause of Tia's death."Considering the negative findings and exclusions including the toxicology, and taking into account the case as a whole as presented to me, some form of suffocation or chest compression would appear to be the most likely cause of death," he told the jury. But he said that, as he could not be sure, the formal cause of death was recorded as "unascertained".He said there was nothing to suggest she had fallen down the stairs and died, as Hazell claims.Fegan-Earl told the court: "Throughout my examinations I could find no evidence of injuries that would suggest an accidental cause of death such as a fall."The court heard Tia's body was found wrapped in a black sheet, covered by plastic wrapping secured with tape.She was wearing pink and white pyjama bottoms, with a top that had the emblem "Little Miss Giggles" on it and a bra, both of which were rucked up.There were no visible signs of external injury, but bruising or indications of suffocation would have been difficult to detect that long after Tia's death, Fegan-Earl said.He found no evidence of a brain haemorrhage, no evidence of compression of the neck, and none of her bones were broken.There was also no fracture of the neck, no bruising in that area and no damage to the spinal cord, he told the jury.He said there was no pathological evidence of serious sexual assault.Hazell, from New Addington, denies murder. The trial continues.
