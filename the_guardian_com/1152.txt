An innovative unit designed to save the lives of vulnerable women prisoners was opened yesterday at Styal prison, in Cheshire, where six women died over 12 months between 2002 and 2003.In the past, new prisoners would usually go on to Waite wing, where five of the six deaths occurred. Now, for at least two nights, women will stay in bright and comfortable surroundings at the "first night" centre, where they will be screened and begin to take advantage of welfare facilities. The former segregation unit has also been remodelled and Styal's governor, Steve Hall, said its ethos will no longer have a punitive element. He hoped the centre would reduce anxiety and distress felt by women arriving in custody, many of them after sudden separation from their families. He confirmed there had been 41 attempted hangings over the Mother's day weekend. Research suggests that most deaths and incidents of self-harm occur in the initial period of custody. The centre, which includes a detoxification unit and mental health assessment programme, aims to target and treat women at risk. Toni, 30, who had been in the unit for two weeks, said it had changed from her previous sentences. "It was all bang up before and staff ignored you," she said. "Now, I'm out of the cell most of the time and we have a common room." The prisons minister, Paul Goggins, said: "People are punished by loss of their liberty but, once here, it is our duty to provide a safe and secure environment for them."
