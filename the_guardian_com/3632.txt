Theft of a mobile phone may be just opportunism, but could be part of multi-million-pound racket whereby tens of thousands of stolen mobiles are smuggled from the UK to Europe, Asia, or Africa.The police, Home Office, customs officials and the telecoms industry have set up a national mobile phone crime unit to gather intelligence and develop technology to stop thefts. Scotland Yard yesterday said that 83 mobiles were stolen in London each day, half the daily total for England and Wales. Of 1,000 street crimes in London each week, a third involved the theft of just a mobile phone. But gangs increasingly target shops and warehouses for larger hauls to sell abroad. Handsets can fetch between £300 and £600 each in India, Pakistan and Africa. The unit, officially launched today, has carried out 40 operations in a month. "We've identified people preparing phones for 'export' through Heathrow and we've identified stolen phones being used in France, Asia and Africa," explained Detective Superintendent Eddie Thomson, the Met officer in charge. "The handsets can be blocked in the UK, but they can be reprogrammed. In Asia, Africa and much of the rest of Europe, they do not even need to be reprogrammed. A new Sim card is inserted and they work." "We need to understand where these phones are going and work on ways to make them worthless to the thieves," said Commander John Yates, senior Met officer in charge of crime. He said there were 51 million mobile phones in the UK, with many households owning four or five.
