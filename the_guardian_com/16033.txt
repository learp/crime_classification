A cut in street crime promised by the prime minister, Tony Blair, to the Commons in April today appeared to have materialised with the publication of Home Office figures showing a 14% drop in offences in 10 of the worst areas of the country.The home secretary, David Blunkett, said a Â£67m project across 10 police forces had resulted in 2,000 fewer robberies in August this year compared to March - the month before the iniative began.But reports today suggested that large successes in some of the 10 forces would mask poorer performances in others.And some forces involved were thought to be struggling to meet the targets as interim figures showed street crime continuing to rise in some areas. Mr Blair promised that street crime would be "brought under control" by September. There was surprise at the pledge, coming at a time when crime levels were still rising after a massive jump of 31% last year.The 10 forces invoved in the street crime initiative are: Metropolitan, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Avon and Somerset, South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Thames Valley and Lancashire, which the Home Office said accounted for 80% of robberies.Half of all robberies occurred in just 20 local council areas, headed by Lambeth in south London.One the largest successes came in nearby Wandsworth, south London, where a 31% cut was recorded.Mr Blunkett was in the area this morning with the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to thank officers for their efforts."The impact we are beginning to make on this problem across the country is down to the efforts of all those we got round the table in March to put in place a coordinated strategy to deal with what was an escalating trend," he said."The police and all those involved have achieved a lot so far, but the fight against street crime will not stop now or at the end of September."South Yorkshire police announced that its efforts to tackle the street crime crisis had seen robbery and snatch thefts drop by 25% - the second best performance of the 10.Lancashire police showed a mixed performance with overall robbery down 10% for the period, but the number of muggings went up by 10% in the 22 weeks.Chief Superintendent Mike Barton said there was a "clear downward trend" in street crime over the period with personal robbery down 11.7% and thefts from the person down 3.8%. Home Office statistics said there were 70 fewer victims a day throughout August compared to March.
