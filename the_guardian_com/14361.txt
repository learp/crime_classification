Armed police have broken up a criminal gang selling weapons to young men intent on fomenting violence at the Notting Hill carnival.Officers discovered a haul of weapons including CS gas, stun guns and knives at a home in south-east London which they said was being used as a weapons store.A 17-year-old youth who lived at the address in Bermondsey was arrested for possession of prohibited weapons and was released on bail last night while police analysed the haul and a small quantity of drugs, Scotland Yard said.In the raid on the property, officers found 22 CS gas canisters, eight stun guns, a gas-powered handgun and silencer, an extendable baton, a flick knife and cannabis.Detective Sergeant Sean Stewart said: "Our work is ongoing and we will do all we can to prevent people from committing crime at the carnival."Chief Inspector Jo Edwards said: "By running an operation before carnival gets under way, we aim to disrupt and stop criminals from going to the event. Thousands of people fill the streets of Notting Hill every August bank holiday and crime rates remain relatively low."During the carnival weekend the police would target people on the move with the aim of taking action before they arrived at the event. "At carnival itself, there are large numbers of police officers, supported by a complete CCTV network, who again will be targeting the small minority who commit crime and disorder."
