A man jailed over the death of Baby P is back in prison after breaching his bail conditions.Jason Owen was originally handed a six-year sentence for causing or allowing the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly.Owen, from Bromley, Kent, was a lodger at the home of his brother Steven Barker in Tottenham, north London, where Peter died on 3 August 2007.In May 2009, an Old Bailey judge gave Owen an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of three years for his part in the boy's death.This meant he could apply for parole after three years but would only be released once the Parole Board was satisfied he no longer posed a risk to the public.Owen challenged his sentence at the court of appeal and in October 2009 was ordered to serve a fixed six-year jail term instead.He was then released on parole in August 2011, halfway through his jail term, taking into account the 289 days he spent in custody on remand before he was sentenced.The circumstances surrounding his recall to prison are unclear.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: "Public protection is our priority. Offenders released on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions and controls. If they fail to comply with their licence conditions, they are liable to be returned to custody."
