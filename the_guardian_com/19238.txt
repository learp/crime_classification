The family of the "beautiful, bright, caring girl" whose life Phillip Simelane took away with one single violent act have described their struggle to come to terms with the loss.Christina Edkins' parents and siblings said the senselessness of the crime had made their grief that much harder to bear on top of the loss of the schoolgirl, just two weeks after her 16th birthday.Jason and Kathleen Edkins and Christina's brother, Ryan, and sister, Joanne, also made it clear that questions remain over why Simelane had not been supervised after his release from jail at the end of 2012.Her great-uncle, Chris Melia, added that if 23-year-old Simelane had been properly monitored after his release, the attack on the top deck of the No 9 bus on the morning of 7 March, would not have happened.The teenager's family thanked all those whose "many acts of kindness" have made their trauma a little easier to bear, including good wishes from people who had never known the schoolgirl but who had been touched by her loss.Christina, they said, came from an ordinary, quiet and hard-working family and was loved by everyone.It was her caring nature that lent a desire to become a nurse or a midwife, her parents said.They also revealed the pride in finding out she had passed 11 GCSEs, tempered with the bittersweet knowledge she was not there to open her own results letter, nor wear the lilac dress she bought for the school prom.Students and teachers at Leasowes high school in Halesowen, West Midlands, paid their own tribute to Christina, dedicating the prom to her memory and writing their own personal messages in the school's yearbook, which her mother and father found "deeply moving".In a statement, her family said they had been pulled apart by the "horror, distress and pain" of Simelane's devastating crime, and had been robbed of their privacy by the high profile of the case."Nothing will restore Christina to us," they said."The loss of a child is the worst thing that can happen, made even more grievous by such a senseless crime."The family are all innocent victims and must pay the penalty as we stand helplessly by and watch the lives of the people we love shattered like glass, knowing we can never put the fragile pieces back together."Welcoming the outcome of the court hearing, the family said it would "bring an element of resolution in that the sentence passed means the public is protected from this man".They added: "However, he was allowed the freedom not only to take the life of an innocent child but, in doing so, to ensure the lives of the people whom she loved are forever affected as a result of his crime."Despite the family's loss, Melia said there was "no feeling of vengeance or retribution" toward Simelane. "It's just a matter of 'get him out of society'," he added.
