The prosecutor said the offences, allegedly committed between 2007 and 2013, were a significant breach of trust.Reynolds, of Farnham, Surrey, is accused of four counts of theft. The first three relate to fees he should have sent to the Wakefield Diocesan Board of Finance, for marriages, funeral and churchyard monuments respectively. The fourth count relates to fees for monuments that should have gone to the parochial church council.The defendant denies all the charges.The trial continues.
