A Northern Ireland solicitor was jailed for 10 years yesterday after pleading guilty to inciting loyalist terrorists to murder. Manmohan "Johnny'' Sandhu, 44, based in County Derry, also pleaded guilty to four charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice at Belfast crown court. They arose from the attempted murder of a taxi driver Jonathan Hillier in August 2005 and the murders of Jameson Lockhart and Andrew Cully. Mr Justice Deeny said: "The picture is not that of an officer of the court discharging his duty to his client but of an enthusiastic gang member."
