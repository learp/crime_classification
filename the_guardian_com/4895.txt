Two boys have been arrested over the murder of a teenager on a busy high street.Yemurai Kanyangarara, 16, was stabbed in the neck seconds after getting off a bus, in what police suspected was a feud between pupils from two different schools.Detectives described the murder in Welling, south-east London, as one of the most brutal they had seen in 25 years.A 15-year-old boy from Peckham and a 14-year-old boy from Camberwell were arrested on Monday on suspicion of murder, Scotland Yard said.One witness said he watched the boy's life "slip away" as he lay on the pavement on Upper Wickham Lane. Kanyangarara's father, Kelton, left a message on his Facebook page that read: "My boy is gone it is so painful â€“ my heart is bleeding. RIP my boy I will always love you."Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dunne told reporters: "You've got someone 16 years old, a schoolboy, being stabbed in broad daylight in a busy street in front of many, many shoppers out enjoying the afternoon. It's about as bad as it gets."It's among the very worst I've investigated in 25 years, the sheer brutality against a defenceless schoolboy."Kanyangarara, who came to Britain from Zimbabwe when he was a toddler, stepped off a No 96 bus with a friend and was attacked, probably within a matter of seconds, during the Friday rush hour.The victim lived in Belvedere and was a pupil at St Columba's Catholic Boys' School in Bexleyheath, where he had recently finished his GCSEs.Yemurai's headmaster had described him as "polite". Mr Dunne said. "If you asked him to do something, he would do it with a smile on his face."Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information that might assist police was asked to call the incident room at Lewisham police station on 020 8721 4906, or, if wishing to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
