It is understood David Chaytor will be taken from Southwark crown court to Wandsworth prison in south-west London to begin his 18-month sentence.Mark Leech, editor of ConVerse, the national newspaper for prisoners, said the former MP should expect "to find himself in a prison reception that is cramped, cold and busy – with up to 200 prisoners being processed each day"."Like all others who come with him he will be strip-searched, photographed, fingerprinted, showered, placed on a bodily orifice scanner to ensure he is not concealing contraband, before being issued with prison clothing and a prison number and then left to consider his future in a reception cubicle holding around 20 others."Before he leaves the Victorian reception he will be seen by medical staff who will ask if he has drink or drugs problems, he will be given a free telephone call to a loved one and will be issued with basic toiletries such as toothpaste, soap and shampoo."Most of the weekend ahead he will spend locked in his cell in the first-night centre, he will be allowed one hour of exercise and be served three meals a day, but the majority of the weekend he will be locked in his cell – where he will have access to just a television and a toilet."Chaytor's induction to prison life will begin on Monday, Leech added, with interviews by security staff who will make an assessment as to the likelihood of him escaping and the danger he might pose if he were successful.The former MP is likely to be moved out of the first-night centre on Tuesday and allocated a cell on one of the main prison wings, Leech said.But he added: "The governor may decide to keep him separate from others if it is felt that the focus upon him means he represents a risk of unrest or security problems."Chaytor will be then be interviewed by education staff and members of the prison chaplaincy, and will be able to call upon the services of "listeners" – prisoners who are selected and trained by the Samaritans to help inmates through their first week behind bars."It is often said that the first week and the last week of a prison sentence are the worst to cope with," Leech said. "Before too long he will come to terms with his sentence and start to progress to better regimes and lower security."Prison is not the end of the world it may at first appear. Of course, he will be ridiculed by other inmates – they like nothing more than to see people fall from grace – but there is nothing in his crimes that should make him afraid of other prisoners and thousands go through jail each year and come out the other side and he can do so too."He should keep a diary from day one – if other 'dishonourable members' are any example to follow, there is money to be made once the darkest days are over."Leech added: "It is certain the prison authorities will not to keep him in Wandsworth prison for too long. With hundreds coming and going each day, they do not have the space."
