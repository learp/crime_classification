Six prison officers who discovered the aftermath of a Hannibal Lecter-style execution, in which the victim's organs had been removed, were yesterday awarded damages and costs said to be in excess of Â£1m for the "severe psychological injuries" they suffered as a result.The officers had entered a cell in Cardiff prison, in April 2000, to discover the remains of a prisoner who had been killed by his cellmate. Using shoelaces, Jason Ricketts, then 29, had strangled Colin Bloomfield, 35, before slicing him open with a homemade scalpel. He then removed the dead man's eye and liver and placed them on top of a locker. The staff were responding to a cell alarm activated by Ricketts.The two men shared a cell in the vulnerable prisoners unit for just 24 hours.Nigel Cooksley QC, representing the officers, told Cardiff county court the scene they encountered had caused psychological injuries to all six men, who ended up covered in the victim's blood as they tried to calm Ricketts down.
