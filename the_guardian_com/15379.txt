A 33-year-old part-time pub worker who handcuffed and stabbed to death a 16-year-old girl in his car was yesterday jailed for life.Darren Cornelius pleaded guilty to murdering Gemma Clarke, who also worked as a part-time catering assistant in the Nag's Head, 200 yards from her home in Martock, near Yeovil, Somerset. Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, said that one night Cornelius had been drinking in the pub and told Gemma he had an interest in magic. She told one of her friends that he had asked her to meet him at a recreation ground where he would show her a trick involving handcuffs. But after the two left the pub he lured her into his car and drove to a remote country lane near the village of Stembridge, handcuffed her and tried to have sex with her. Cornelius then produced a kitchen knife and stabbed her six times in the chest, before removing her underwear and leaving her body by the side of the road. He went home before returning just before 4am to move her body to another country lane several miles away near the hamlet of West Lambrook, where it was found the next day by a horse rider. Later that day Cornelius withdrew some money from his father's account and took a train from Yeovil to London, where he was arrested the next day. Defending, Patrick Mason said Cornelius was an "inadequate" man who could not hold down a steady job or relationship and had been bullied at school. Cornelius could not explain why he had killed Gemma, but said he was in a "chaotic state of mind". The judge, Mr Justice Maurice Kay, said Gemma was an intelligent, lively, outgoing, decent girl. "I have no doubt that she would have achieved much had she lived."Press Association
