The number of police officers in England and Wales has risen back to the level seen before Labour came to power and is now at a six-year high point, government figures showed today.The Home Office said that, with 127,231 officers, the numbers are at their highest since February 1995.Recruitment rose by more than 69% in the past year, the largest annual increase since 1979.However, the number of officers available for ordinary duty, excluding those on secondments to the National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Squad and other duties, is still fractionally below that of March 1997.When secondments are taken into account, there are 73 more officers in England and Wales than there were prior to the 1997 election. The prime minister, Tony Blair, who today visited a Metropolitan police recruitment office in central London, said: "We are building from a firm base - the chance of becoming a crime victim is now at its lowest level in 20 years - but the case for further reform is also compelling."The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: "Increasing the number of bobbies on the beat is a key plank to our police reform agenda. "I am determined to make their job more rewarding by stripping away unnecessary red tape and using trained civilian support staff where appropriate."The government may have been concerned by data showing that the number of officers retiring or leaving the job for other reasons rose by 5% last year.And 18 regional forces still have fewer officers than in March 1997, including the Metropolitan police, which has 1,303 fewer policemen, although part of the decrease can be explained by boundary changes which came into force last year. Three forces showed falls in the number of officers last year. Staffordshire police numbers fell by 1.8%, Thames Valley by 1.1% and City of London by 2.8%.The number of ethnic minority officers rose by 9.9% to 3,107.
