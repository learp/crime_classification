A 23-year-old man who stabbed a City banker and a diplomat after one of their friends accidentally threw a lollipop stick at his car was jailed indefinitely today. Darius Antoine, 23, of Hackney, east London, was told he must serve a minimum of six years.Recorder William Boyce QC said Antoine stabbed Ben McKinney and Brian Dorsett outside a West End nightclub in the early hours of 6 December last year. The victims both suffered serious chest wounds, Southwark crown court in central London was told. But McKinney was able to take down the car's registration number and Antoine was later arrested. The attack happened outside the Moonlighting nightclub in Greek Street, Soho, at about 5am. Investment banker Adlai Kerr threw a lollipop stick into the road, accidentally hitting the rear windscreen of a white BMW but causing no damage and leaving no marks.Antoine got out of the car and demanded an apology, but the group from the nightclub thought he was making a mountain out of a mole hill, the judge said.He went back to the car to get the knife and returned to stab McKinney, a banker. He then went back to the car again but seeing Dorsett, a diplomat at the Bahamian embassy, was "totally helpless" and held in a full nelson by another man, Antoine returned to stab him in the chest. The judge said Antoine was lucky that both men made full recoveries.Witnesses then saw Antoine head to the boot of another car and arm himself with a pair of nunchucks, a martial arts weapon. He was caught on video, swinging the nunchucks around in a "completely arrogant and self-confident" manner, "prepared to take on anybody", the judge said.Antoine, who had shaved off his distinctive corn-rows hairstyle by the time of his arrest 10 days later, claimed he had been wrongly identified.But McKinney picked him out as his attacker in a video identification parade and he was found guilty of two counts of wounding with intent last month.
