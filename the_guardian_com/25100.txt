The Home Office is expected to be criticised in the Bichard report, commissioned during the Soham inquiry into the murder of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by Ian Huntley.The criticisms, to be published this week, will centre on officials' refusal to authorise adequate funding for the national computer system, Valiant, which was designed to speed up the process of sharing information across police forces. In the Soham case, information held by Humberside police about Huntley's record as a sex offender was not passed to Cambridgeshire police when checks were carried out on the school caretaker. The future of the chief constables of Cambridgeshire and Humberside will be called into question as a result of the report, and it is likely that calls for resignations will follow publication. It is unlikely that under the present arrangements the two officers will have to resign without pressure from their respective police authorities. Under new legislation, the Home Office's Police Standards Unit can take over the running of individual forces, but only if they are judged to be failing by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The chief constables will only be removed if an inquiry makes specific criticism of their failures. The inquiry is likely to focus on the period when Labour came to power in 1997 when, according to the police, adequate resources for the Valiant system were not authorised. As a result of lack of funding, many individual police forces still have their own IT systems that run in parallel to the national system.
