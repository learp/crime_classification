A 23-year-old woman was today found guilty of murdering a man who she and her boyfriend chopped up and fed through a domestic mincer before dumping in a skip.Karen Morris, of Selly Park, Birmingham, was convicted at the city's crown court after a jury rejected her claim of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. Her partner, Steven Parton, 39, a former stripper, of Perry Barr, also Birmingham, had admitted murder at a previous hearing.The pair are due to be sentenced later today for murdering Nelvaughn Brade, 22. Mr Brade was lodging with Parton when he was shot at with a crossbow as he took a shower in the early hours of November 5 last year.The bolt missed his neck and the man tried to escape but he was eventually floored and Parton attacked his head with an axe. Morris is thought to have dealt the fatal blow, stabbing Mr Brade in the neck.In the days following the murder, the couple dismembered Mr Brade's body and put his flesh put through a mincer. His remains were packed into two oil drums which the couple drove more than 100 miles to throw on a skip, later dumped on a landfill site near King's Lynn in Norfolk.Less than a week later, on November 11, the pair - who had attempted to commit suicide the day before - handed themselves in at police station in Hunstanton, Norfolk.A three-day search of the tip was carried out and three bin bags containing Brade's organs, bones and limbs were recovered.Opening the case against Morris last week, Julia Macur QC, prosecuting, said: "The flesh had been removed almost completely from his skeleton. It had been minced through a domestic mincer. The flesh was found in two 25-gallon plastic oil drums."Speaking after Parton had been brought into the dock following Morris' conviction, Ms Macur said expert analysis revealed the body had been dismembered "proficiently" and that skin on the palm of both hands and one foot had been removed "cleanly and expertly" to hinder identification.Various reasons were advanced in court as possible motives for the murder.Ms Macur said Mr Brade had been distributing cannabis Parton was growing and there was concern his housemate was going to steal his 3,500-strong crop of plants.Morris had once had sex with Mr Brade and he had allegedly bombarded her with phone calls when their relationship ended, threatening to stab or shoot her.Ms Macur said the pair had also formed the opinion that Mr Brade was intending to kidnap Parton's mother and hold her until the deeds to the house were passed over to him.The prosecutor also alleged that the killers decided the only way to get rid of the lodger was to murder him and so they set about buying a crossbow, knives, an axe and a metal bar with which to dispose of him.
