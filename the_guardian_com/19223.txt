A father who ordered his two teenage sons to carry out the honour killing of a university student who had made his daughter pregnant was yesterday sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in jail. Bangladeshi waiter Chomir Ali, 44, ordered his sons to kill 19-year-old Arash Ghorbani-Zarin, an Iranian Muslim studying electrical engineering at Oxford Brookes University.Mr Justice Goss, who last month presided over the trio's trial at Oxford crown court when all three were found guilty of murder, sentenced Ali and sons Mujibar Rahman, 19, and Mamnoor Rahman, 16, all of Asquith Road, Oxford, to life. Sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, he said Mujibar Rahman should serve at least 16 years before he can be considered for parole. Mamnoor Rahman will have to serve at least 14 years.The judge said it was a "cold-blooded intentional killing". He told the three: "Far from vindicating your family's honour you have permanently dishonoured your family with the stain of murder." The jury heard of how Ali had become angry in the summer of 2003 when his 20-year-old daughter Manna Begum began going out with Mr Ghorbani-Zarin, since he already had an arranged marriage planned for her.After months of attempting to stop the relationship Ali ordered his sons to kill their sister's boyfriend. On November 20 last year Mr Ghorbani-Zarin's body was found with 46 stab wounds, mostly to the chest, in his car in an Oxford suburb.After the hearing, the victim's father Raheem Ghorbani-Zarin said: "I am devastated by the sentences. This is not justice. I wanted life to mean life - at least 25 years so my boy can rest under the ground."
