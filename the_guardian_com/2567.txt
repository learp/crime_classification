It was his first outing on the frontline as Metropolitan police commissioner but, unfortunately for Sir Paul Stephenson, someone else had been there first.Stephenson led a dawn raid on a burglary suspect yesterday with 80 officers, a helicopter and a London evening newspaper journalist and photographer in tow to observe just how it should be done. But when the police arrived at the door of the suspected gang leader, wearing riot helmets and carrying a battering ram, they smashed their way in only to discover their man was not there.He had been arrested several hours earlier - at 1.30am yesterday - by officers from Kingston upon Thames on suspicion of breaking into a house. While Stephenson and other officers were being briefed about the raid on a gang who break into homes to steal the keys to high-performance cars, the suspect they wanted was being booked into custody. Because his arrest had not yet been logged, Stephenson and his entourage had gone ahead with the raid, causing embarrassment all round. The commissioner told London's Evening Standard, which had sent a journalist on the raid with him: "That's policing."He added: "This was the culmination of a long-running operation which has seen a number of people arrested. This was all about catching villains and making people feel safer in their homes. The operation was very professional. "The suspect was not there but that is the nature of police work." Two women were detained and police seized Â£15,000 cash and an Aston Martin DB7 parked in the driveway of the home in Kenley, near Purley. Police have already arrested nine people who are suspected of targeting affluent properties in south London and the home counties.Stephenson was appointed Met commissioner in January after the controversial reign of Sir Ian Blair ended when he was forced out by the Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.
