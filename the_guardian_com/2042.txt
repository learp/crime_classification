Children under 16 caught carrying a blade in public are to be sent on day-long courses at which hospital staff will educate them about injuries caused by stabbing. Under the package of measures agreed by Gordon Brown yesterday they may also be taken on prison visits to show them the consequences of a custodial sentence.The measures were agreed at a Downing Street breakfast summit at which the prime minister confirmed that anyone aged 16 or 17 caught in possession of a knife for the first time can in future expect to be taken to court and prosecuted rather than cautioned. "We have to send out a message and reinforce it with immediate action," said Brown. "It is completely unacceptable to carry a knife. Young people need to understand that carrying knives doesn't protect you, it does the opposite - it increases the danger for all of us, destroys young lives and ruins families."Those under 16 can still expect to be given a caution for a first offence but the Home Office said they could also expect to be referred to a knife education programme. Their parents will also be told and may receive parenting orders.Sir Ken Macdonald, the director of public prosecutions, said: "People who carry knives put themselves as well as others at serious risk of injury. Those caught in possession of a knife in a public place and with no reasonable excuse can expect to be prosecuted."
