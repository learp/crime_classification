 Detectives have named a boy they are urgently trying to trace in connection with the murder of a teenager on Sunday.Dawda Jallow, 15, from Peckham, south London, is wanted for questioning in connection with the death of Dogan Ismail, 17, who was stabbed after what was believed to be an altercation over a mobile phone.Ismail had been walking with his brother when they encountered a group of four males on Sunday afternoon on the Aylesbury estate, Walworth.The Metropolitan police and London ambulance service were called at 4.20pm but the victim was pronounced dead at the scene. A postmortem examination found Ismail, from Peckham, had been killed by a single stab wound.Detectives have taken the unusual step of naming a youth. Described as black, clean shaven with cropped black afro hair, 5ft 5in tall and slightly built, Jallow is a Gambian national but speaks with a London accent.Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner, of the homicide and serious crime command, leading the investigation, said: "I am seeking help from the local community to locate Dawda Jallow. I appeal to anyone who knows of his whereabouts, or has any information that could assist us, to come forward."If Dawda is seen, please do not approach him but contact police. I appeal direct to Dawda to present himself at a police station so this matter can be dealt with."There is no evidence to suggest this attack was gang related and Dogan did not have any history of gang activity."A 15-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, but they were later bailed.Bonner added: "My thoughts go out to Dogan's family, who have been left devastated by his senseless killing. That it should happen at this time of year is all the more tragic. I would like to urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward and speak with my officers or, if they would prefer to remain anonymous, [with] Crimestoppers."
