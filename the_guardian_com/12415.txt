German police last night used pepper spray to disperse fighting England fans in Cologne.Fourteen people were arrested in what was the first outbreak of trouble involving the team's supporters in the World Cup so far.Clashes flared as around 2,000 England fans - among 70,000 in Cologne for England's Group B decider against Sweden this evening - drank in the Alter Markt, one of the city's old squares.Fighting began when fans began throwing bottles at a man who had climbed a statue in the square, causing him to fall, German police said."There was an England fan at the top of the statue, and somehow he dropped a bottle of beer by mistake," Superintendent Stefan Schwarz said."That provoked a reaction in the crowd. People at the bottom got angry because they were hit by broken glass, and started throwing missiles at the man on the statue. The man fell from the statue. We don't know how badly hurt he is."The England fans were throwing bottles at the German police, and that's when we had to intervene to clear the area."However, the trouble - during which 16 police officers were slightly hurt - ended quickly. All those arrested were released with no action taken against them, British police in Germany said.England fans have spent the vast majority of the tournament belying a decades-long reputation for violence.The team's first two games, against Paraguay in Frankfurt and Trinidad and Tobago in Nuremberg, saw only a handful of arrests.The bulk of those detained were held for breaching stadium regulations, drunkenness, or - in a small number of cases - making Nazi salutes or similar actions.Britain's ambassador to Germany, Sir Peter Torry, praised the fans' behaviour. "The story of this tournament is that the English fans are coming here in their thousands," he said."They are contributing hugely to the success of this event, and doing the reputation of English football and the country proud."Klaus Steffenhagen, the head of Cologne's police force, echoed the sentiment, saying English supporters' link with hooliganism was "a reputation from the last century"."We, from the start, did not take part in spreading these horror scenarios, because we knew from the start that English fans are not different from other fans," he added.British police, including uniformed officers and anti-hooligan specialists, have been in Germany throughout the tournament, liaising with their German counterparts.Before the World Cup began, more than 3,000 known English troublemakers subject to so-called banning orders were forced to surrender their passports.England's footballers are already certain of progressing through to the second round, needing a draw against Sweden to top group B.
