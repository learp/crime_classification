Mugshots of convicted paedophiles who have absconded from supervision in the community could be posted on the internet to warn children and parents, a new government organisation, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, revealed yesterday.Some fear the tactic could trigger vigilante attacks, but the centre planned to press ahead. Its chief executive, Jim Gamble, warned paedophiles they should "get help or get caught" because the internet was no longer seen as unpoliceable.The unit will have access to the latest technology.
