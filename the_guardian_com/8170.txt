The mother of two young boys who died when they were trapped in a house fire in East Sussex on Saturday was today arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and child neglect.Lewis Jenkins, seven, and his five-year-old brother, Taylor, died after becoming locked in the burning house in Eastbourne.Their mother, Denise Goldsmith, was treated in hospital for minor injuries suffered while attempting to reach them.It is thought a door slammed shut behind the 29-year-old as she ran to get help, leaving the boys trapped in the house.They were believed to have been under the stairs but, despite desperate attempts by neighbours, nobody was able to get into the building to rescue them.In a statement, Sussex police said the fire was not being treated as arson at this stage. "Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Sussex police's major crime branch has arrested a 29-year-old woman on suspicion of manslaughter and child neglect," the statement said. "The cause of the fire, which led to the deaths of Lewis and Taylor Jenkins ... is part of an ongoing investigation of this tragic incident, but at this stage it is not being treated as arson." Jason Maynard, a neighbour who tried to break in through the front and back doors of the house, said at the weekend: "I heard screaming and the sound of breaking glass. "The mother was already outside and was screaming for someone to go in and get her kids. "We couldn't get in - there were flames everywhere. We couldn't hear the boys - she thought they were under the stairs. There was nothing we could do."Goldsmith later laid flowers outside the house in memory of her two sons.Police and fire officers are continuing to carry out a forensic investigation into the cause of the fire. "It's a difficult scene, and we've got many challenges there because of the extent of the damage," Detective Inspector Trevor Bowles, of Sussex police, said.
