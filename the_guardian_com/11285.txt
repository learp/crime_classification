A young Australian woman suffered a terrifying two-hour ordeal at the hands of two thugs who jumped into her car at traffic lights in central London.The men assaulted her at knifepoint as they forced her to drive round and then pushed her out of the moving vehicle so that she was knocked unconscious. The attack took place between 2am and 4am on Monday after the 27-year-old became lost while as she was driving back to her home in the Midlands following a holiday in France. As she pulled up at lights in South Brent, two men leapt into her grey Peugeot 205. When the victim came round she did not know where she was and had to walk to a taxi office in Kensal Rise to call the police. "This was terrifying attack on a young, defenceless female travelling through central London," said Detective Inspector Glen Lloyd. "If you saw anything that could help us get a clearer picture of what happened, please contact us."Her attackers were both black. One was in his mid-20s with chiselled cheekbones, shoulder-length dreadlocks, black round glasses and a leather jacket. The other had a chubby face, brown eyes and wore a thick silver chain and a white and light blue baseball sweater.
