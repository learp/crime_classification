The chairman of Humberside police authority has been arrested in connection with child abuse allegations, it has emerged.Colin Inglis, who is also a former leader of Hull city council, was arrested yesterday by officers from North Yorkshire police following its investigations into historic child abuse claims against him which originally surfaced in the 1980s. He was later released from custody and bailed.A police investigation nine years ago focused on his time as a social worker in a council children's home, Gleneagles in Hull. At that time Mr Inglis was interviewed under caution for 18 hours, but the allegations were dismissed by the Crown Prosecution Service as lacking sufficient evidence.A police spokesman said today: "Police can confirm that a 48-year-old man was arrested yesterday in relation to allegations of historic child abuse in the Humberside area and has been bailed to a future date." Mr Inglis was voted out of office as leader of Hull council - the worst performing council in England - last month.He was also in the headlines last year when as leader of the police authority he backed the refusal of the Humberside chief constable, David Westwood, to resign over failures highlighted in the Soham inquiry.
