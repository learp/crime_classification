A farmer who pocketed more than a quarter of a million pounds with an illegal landfill, which gave off such a stink neighbours complained, has escaped a jail term.Paul Morris allowed more than 87,000 tonnes of controlled waste to be dumped in a disused reservoir at Carreg Bica Isaf farm in Hilltop, Tredegar, south Wales.He got away with the lucrative illegal dumping for four years before the authorities got a whiff of what he was up to.In December 2010 Morris's farm and a local waste company were raided by 50 Environment Agency officers working with Gwent police.Evidence seized was integral to the case against Morris when he eventually stood trial at Newport crown court last month.More than 20 companies were investigated by the environmental crime team after being identified as having tipped waste at the site.Morris had denied a single count of knowingly permitting the deposit of controlled waste without a permit or a licence but was found guilty by a jury.The charge amounted to an accusation that he ran an illegal landfill – an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990.He was told that he will also be facing proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.He was given a 10-month jail term suspended for two years. Morris was also given a 12-month supervision order.Morris made £283,000 by allowing 4,700 individual loads of waste to be illegally dumped on his land from March 2006.He was able to hide what he was doing by simply dumping inert material on top of it, but was caught due to the accumulated stench it began giving off.Environment Agency officers first visited the farm, near Newport, in August 2010, after neighbours complained about the strong smell at the farm.They found decomposing waste and a dark-coloured runoff, known as leachate, escaping into nearby woodland.Samples taken from the farmland in September 2010 showed ammonia levels as high as in raw sewage. The water would not have been able to sustain river fish.
