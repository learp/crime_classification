The retrial of Achilleas Kallakis, the former travel agent accused of posing as a Mayfair-based shipping tycoon in order to dupe Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Scotland into lending more than £750m to fund a string of ill-fated property purchases, began at Southwark crown court on Tuesday.Victor Temple QC, counsel for the Serious Fraud Office, told a new jury that sums had been advanced to Kallakis' empire after he and alleged accomplices arranged for false and forged documents to be sent to the banks falsely purporting to confirm his significant wealth and to offer further guarantees that the lenders could rely on.Kallakis and co-defendant Alex Williams, a friend and alleged "prolific … versatile and competent forger", deny 23 counts of conspiracy to defraud. The court heard how the two had a previous conviction for conspiracy to commit forgery after pleading guilty to making use of forged documents as part of a business in the 1990s selling bogus honorific titles to Americans. Both men had changed their names after the conviction.The alleged confidence trick on AIB and Bank of Scotland, which is now part of Lloyds Banking Group, relied heavily on the involvement of a Swiss lawyer Michael Becker, Temple said. He told jurors they should not speculate as to why Becker was not alongside Kallakis and Williams in the dock. The trial continues.
