Men accused of rape and sexual assault can no longer question their alleged victims in Scottish courts under legislation which came into force yesterday.The new law, which is framed to make women less apprehensive about coming forward with rape allegations, brings Scotland in line with the rest of the UK.But the measures go a step further than in England and Wales: in Scotland, an alleged victim's sexual history can now only be brought up by defence lawyers if the defendant's previous history of sexual offences is disclosed to the jury. Under the Sexual Offence (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Act, anyone charged with a sex offence will be required to appoint a solicitor or have one appointed by the court. Defence lawyers will also have to tell the court at least 14 days before trial if they intend to bring up the victim's sexual history. If they do this, the crown has the automatic right to disclose any previous convictions for sexual offences to the jury. Although the defence will be able to appeal to have this right waived, the new law is likely to lead to many more cases in which the defendant's criminal record is an issue than at present. The legislation comes in the wake of a string of court cases in Scotland where women were subjected to sustained and personal questioning by their alleged attackers. The Scottish justice minister, Jim Wallace, said: "The aim of this legislation is to reduce some of the fear that deters victims from coming forward." He added: "The executive does not believe that victims should be subjected to intense, often degrading, questioning from the very person who is accused of abusing them." Sandy Brindley, spokeswoman for Glasgow Rape Crisis, welcomed the act but said more needed to be done to increase the conviction rate. "It's not going to fully address the concerns that are there about the justice system," she said.
