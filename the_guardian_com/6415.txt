Tony McNulty, the policing minister, has today been placed at the centre of the row over the Home Office's failure to process files on offences committed abroad.Opposition parties have demanded the publication of a letter from the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) last October, warning about the backlog of 27,000 records awaiting entering on the police computer database.That letter was received by Mr McNulty and replied to by Joan Ryan, the junior Home Office minister.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, has called their positions "untenable" if it emerges that they knew of the scope of the problem without acting upon it.This morning the prime minister's spokesman said both Mr McNulty and Ms Ryan retained the full confidence of Mr Blair.Asked about the controversy he said: "What the Home Office said was that there was no evidence that ministers knew of the backlog or the scale of the backlog. That remains the case."Mr McNulty's career is still in recovery after he was moved from the post of immigration minister in the wake of last year's foreign prisoners fiasco.He was shifted sideways to become policing minister.Although his new job was equivalent in rank it was widely seen as a demotion, a suggestion denied by the Home Office and the home secretary, John Reid.The Acpo letter is understood to have suggested alerting the home secretary to the growing problem of processing files on offences committed abroad, but at the heart of the row is whether it specifically demanded more money and resources to clear the backlog.Mr Reid has announced an internal civil service investigation into the matter, but with no guarantee that the letter, or the full results of the probe, will be published.The Liberal Democrats today accused Mr Reid of "hiding behind the skirts of his weakest minister" over the row.The party's home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "It is obvious from the reports of the letter received by Joan Ryan that her claim that ministers knew nothing is entirely discredited."But John Reid should stop asking his junior ministers to take the flak and make the right decisions himself to sort out this mess."He said that Ms Ryan increasingly resembled "a scapegoat who has deliberately been set up to fall"."Her boss should now have the courage to take responsibility for this farce and publish the letters immediately."Yesterday John Reid told us he knew nothing. Today the tough-talking home secretary is hiding behind the skirts of his weakest minister."Mr Clegg has put in a freedom of information request for the letter.Mr Reid - who took over the Home Office in May and immediately declared it "unfit for purpose" - was yesterday forced to make an emergency statement to MPs over the affair.He admitted that the details of 280 Britons convicted abroad of serious offences, including murder, rape and robbery, dating back to 1999 - more than half the total - have yet to be logged on to the criminal records database.Acpo, which took over responsibility for processing foreign conviction reports in May, told Mr Reid it would take a further 12 months to work through the less serious 27,000 case files yet to be processed.
