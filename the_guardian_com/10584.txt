The police are pressing for a domestic violence register, similar to the sex offenders' list, to enable them to track those who repeatedly attack others. The Association of Chief Police Officers said yesterday they wanted the list to help keep tabs on the violent people who moved from one abusive relationship to another.Brian Moore, the Wiltshire chief constable and Acpo spokesman, also told MPs yesterday that the murders sparked by domestic abuse could be halved if a statutory duty was placed on schools, housing and social services departments and the police to share information about domestic violence incidents.The Commons home affairs select committee was told that the scale of domestic violence remained hugely under-reported to the police. A survey estimated there could be as many as 13m incidents a year. Victim Support said last year it helped 403,000 domestic violence victims yet only 40,000 cases ended in a conviction.Moore told the MPs: "Those who go from relationship to relationship across boundaries should be subject to some form of proportionate tracking."He said that despite repeated Home Office guidance there was inadequate sharing of information. "Each agency may have part of the picture, but it is only when all these pieces of information come together that we can have the clearest picture of those who are at risk."Moore said that some places used the Data Protection Act and claims of "client confidentiality" as reasons for not sharing information, but it was time to set obligations on the availability of information when people were at risk of attacks. "We have to act now because year on year other people are losing their lives because of this gap in the law. There are thousands of protocols about sharing information. Thousands of protocols must tell you that there is no clear system."Moore later said that the number of murders each year arising from domestic incidents - 142, including 38 of men - could be halved if the law was changed.A domestic violence register would hold a database based on the 40,000 or so successful convictions a year.The MPs also heard evidence from judges that the new "non-molestation orders", implemented in July, had already run into trouble because of failure by the police to enforce them.
